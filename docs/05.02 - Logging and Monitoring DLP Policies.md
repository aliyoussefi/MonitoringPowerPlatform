# Monitoring DLP Policies

## Policy Summary

## Locking Down v Opening Up and Alerting on an environment

DLP Policies allow administrators the ability to add governance to a Dataverse environment used by licensed users within the tenant. Depending on the nature of the environment administrators may choose to go with various approaches on what connectors makers and users can interact with. Power User environments for instance may allow for more flexibility than environments used as personal productivity environments. For personal productivity environments these are highly restricted, this helps reduce intermingling of business and non-business as well as data or licensing sprawl. I highly recommend reviewing Denise Moran's article [Establishing an Environment Strategy for Microsoft Power Platform | Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/establishing-an-environment-strategy-for-microsoft-power-platform/) for guidance on environment strategies. The article also documents how to establish DLP policies for these environments:

Personal Productivity:

"To reduce risk to data, the types of connectors used in your apps and flows should be limited to a less permissive data loss prevention (DLP) policy. This policy should cover common individual and small team productivity use cases, like working with SharePoint data, sending emails, and having an approval workflow."

Power Users:

"For this purpose, we recommend creating a power user environment. This shared environment should use mre permissive DLP policies and admins should control the maker list to this environment."

I typically see environments used for production workloads well vetted and locked down with DLP policies than standard maker environments.

## Impact on Existing Apps and Flows

As documented in the article [Impact of DLP policies on apps and flows - Power Platform | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/dlp-impact-policies-apps-flows#runtime-impact-on-apps-and-flows) DLP policy restrictions are enforced at both design and run time. Design time restriction is straight forward, a maker will be prompted with an error message and information to learn more. This prompt is displayed when a user attempts to add a connector to a Power App or save a Power Automate flow. Power Automate will save the flow but will keep it in a suspended state until the DLP violation is removed.

For run time usage of Power Apps, users will be prompted with a message that will inform them that the app is not compliant. This messaging can be customized using the PowerShell script mentioned below.

For users looking to invoke a Power Automate flow, they will see the flow marked as suspended. That said, **existing flows that are currently running will continue to run as they have preserved the state of the flow at time of execution.** Previous research for impact of approval flow changes indicates that the state of the flow is retained on execution.

Finally for admins, as noted by the article linked above, the flow suspension process uses a polling mechanism. The DLP policy changes will take roughly five minutes to be marked as suspended. If immediate restriction is needed, consider flow run modifications. These modifications can be made at scale using the DLP SDK.

## Applying Custom Tenant Messages

An obscure but very useful feature is to apply custom DLP violation messaging to a tenant. This allow admins to provide contact information to makers or users who may need access to a connector that is restricted. Also, the messaging allows for a custom URL to be provided that can be used for self-remediation, important notices, business justification, etc.

To set this messaging, use the DLP SDK within the **Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration** PowerShell module. **<u>If you are new to working with Data Loss Prevention Policies within PowerShell</u>**, please take a moment to review the section '**DLP Policies and Power App Administration PowerShell**' in the "[Monitoring the Power Platform: Connectors, Connections and Data Loss Prevention Policies](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate--connectors-and-connections)" article.

The specific command is called **[New-PowerAppDlpErrorSettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#governance-error-message-content-commands)**. The command allows admins much needed flexibility to add custom messaging. The example below is used to set a tenant wide message to contact the DLP security team and a SharePoint link for business justification requests.

```
New-PowerAppDlpErrorSettings -TenantId $tenant -ErrorSettings @{  
  ErrorMessageDetails = @{ 
    enabled = $True  
    url = "https://aka.ms/contosoGovernance" 
  } 
  ContactDetails= @{  
    enabled = $True 
    email = "dlp_support@contoso.com" 
  } 
} 
```

I would recommend using an alias for both the URL and email address. Consider a shortened URL (e.g. https://aka.ms/contosoGovernance) and a distribution list (e.g. dlp_support@contoso.com) for the email address. To update, use the **[Set-PowerAppDlpErrorSettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#update-governance-error-message-content)** command.

Here is an image of a custom error message a user will receive for a blocked connector:

## Karen's Example

In this example Karen is building an app in the personal productivity environment to showcase her team's work within Azure DevOps.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DlpAndSubscriptions/KarenImage.JPG" style="zoom: 80%;" />

She plans to show how her Power App can help reduce project managers' time to collect project updates from the team. She also plans for managers to use the tool when meeting with stakeholders to show progress and collect feedback. Everything is going great until Karen decides to use the Azure DevOps connector in the personal producitivity environment.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DlpAndSubscriptions/KarenAppBlocked.JPG" />

She reaches out to the dlp_support@contoso.com alias requesting access to use the Azure DevOps connector. The support team meet and gain approval to allow Karen to continue her work. However they aren't allowed to give her her own environment so they must come up with a way to allow Karen to continue her work in the personal productivity environment.

NOTE: Ideally we would have an environment for Karen to work with as described above for Power Users. [Trial based environments work very well here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/trial-environments) [Be mindful when creating these environments to apply security groups.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/control-user-access) I've seen where environment sprawl or capacity are concerns so in this example we are restricting environment creation.

## Exempting Resources

Exempting resources allows administrators the ability to white list an app or flow in a specific DLP policy. This is useful for business critical applications that need to continue to run using blocked connectors. This can also serve as a safe guard that this application will continue to run even if a DLP policy is changed restricting a connector used by the app or flow. 

This, used in combination with the custom tenant messaging, is useful to provide granular control and access. When an admin does apply the exemption policy it is for the entire app or flow. Be mindful of what actions will be exposed. If necessary consider moving the exempted resources into their own specific environment with its own DLP policy.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DlpAndSubscriptions/PersonalProductivity.UI.JPG" />

To allow Karen's app to use the Azure DevOps connector while restricting others in the environment to build apps and flows we can use the exempt resources command.

```
$app = Get-PowerApp -EnvironmentName $environment -AppName 93425669-ff6b-4fef-bccb-4f3ef0688007 #Karen's cool app 
$exemptApp = [pscustomobject]@{ 
            id = $app.Internal.id 
            type = $app.Internal.type 
        } 
$exemptResources = [pscustomobject]@{ 
            exemptResources = @($exemptApp)
        }


New-PowerAppDlpPolicyExemptResources -TenantId $tenant -PolicyName 9e390645-f564-4734-a5a0-3b9d8221304b -NewDlpPolicyExemptResources $exemptResources
```


NOTE: This could have negative effects on the reporting of apps and flows impacted in the DLP Editor v2.

## Governance

Governance on exempted resources is extremely important and I recommend having a process that runs regularly to identify the exempted resources. If this number grows or shrinks we should alert the appropriate channels to take action. Alternatively, an automated approach can be taken to ensure non-exempted resources are allowed to be added. Luckily, there are options ranging from no code solutions developed by the community to APIs and SDKs that can be leveraged by administrators who may be more comfortable with scripting automation.

#### Center of Excellence and DLP Editor

For no code solutions, take a look at the Center of Excellence toolkit. The toolkit contains the functionality that will collect connectors used by Power Apps and Power Automate flows and store within a Dataverse environment. The DLP Editor v2 allow admins to use a Power App to better understand what changes to DLP policies can impact what apps and flows. If this tool is used, be mindful that it is unsupported. Also, turn on auditing and evaluate the use of Export to Azure Synapse Analytics to help with tracking historical trends, rich analysis and data processing as well as long term storage.

#### Ingesting Office 365 Management Activity API and Audit Reports with Power Automate Flow

As detailed thoroughly within the "[Monitoring the Power Platform: Power Automate - Auditing and Activity Logs Part 2 - Microsoft Dynamics CRM Community](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate--auditing-and-activity-logs-part-2)" article, I cover how to use a Power Automate Flow or Azure Automation to extract events from the Office 365 activity logs. 

Once enabled, Create, Update and Delete actions taken by administrators will source to the Office 365 Security and Compliance center. Below is an image showing the three different activity records for Data Loss Prevention Policies.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DlpAndSubscriptions/O365Security.DLP.JPG" />

In the image below within the Update DLP Policy activity, we can see that the additionalInfo property contains details of the action taken. In the image, an administrator (or someone with appropriate access) has exempted a resource from our Personal Productivity DLP policy:

<insert DLP exempt image>

Here is the output of the additionalInfo detailing the application that is now exempt. Governance administrators can see both the object identifier as well as the type, in this case a Power App.

```
{"policyId":"9e390645-f564-4734-a5a0-3b9d8221304b","policyType":"OnlyEnvironments","defaultConnectorClassification":"Blocked","changeSet":{"exemptResourcesChanges":[{"name":"/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apps/93425669-ff6b-4fef-bccb-4f3ef0688007","currentValue":{"id":"/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apps/93425669-ff6b-4fef-bccb-4f3ef0688007","type":"Microsoft.PowerApps/apps"}}]}}
```

Here is the logical flow for extracting and storing within Cosmos DB, courtesy of **Amreek Singh**. The destination can easily be changed to a data store of choice such as Azure Blob Storage used for Azure Data Lake.

### Ingesting Office 365 Management Activity API and Audit Reports with Azure Automation

Utilizing **Azure Log Analytics** or **Azure Application Insights** offers native integration with additional monitoring tools to help detect anomalies. Tools such as [**Azure Sentinel**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview), offering a Security Information Event Management ([**SIEM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management)) and Security Orchestration Automated Response (**SOAR**), or [**Azure Monitoring**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview), offering analysis detection solutions, are perfect for this.
