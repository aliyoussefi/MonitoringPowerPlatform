# Monitoring the Power Platform: Power Automate - Run Time Part 2: Tracked Properties and Error Handling

## Summary

**[Microsoft Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/getting-started)** is a service allowing makers to create business processes, orchestrations and workflows to help achieve common and even complex business requirements. Within the Power Platform, Power Automate represents one of the most important pillars of the platform. It provides a no to low code solution to process automation. From sending **[push notifications to mobile devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/add-notifications)**, to complex **[robotic process automation](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/ui-flows/)** flows, Power Automate can be used in virtually any workload.

If you have not already reviewed Part 1 in the Power Automate Run Time series, please do so as this article is a continuation of previous installments. In this article we will discuss **Tracked Properties** and how they can be used across actions with a Microsoft Power Automate Flow. We will then look into handling and capturing error information within actions to help troubleshoot and report on failing actions or flows. Finally we will examine the Try, Catch, Finally pattern and result function for monitoring insights.

## Action Tracked Properties

**Tracked Properties** are part of every action within Power Automate. [They provide the ability to add properties behind the scenes that can be referenced as part of the specific action.](http://johnliu.net/blog/2018/10/hiding-your-microsoft-flow-valuables-i-mean-variables-out-of-sight) With tracked properties, we can set variables such as time stamps, capture trigger headers and outputs, action outputs, or even previous tracked properties from earlier actions. Expressions, such as "utcNow, outputs, actions" can be used to track what normally wouldn't be stored in action inputs. [Tracked properties are packaged within a node in the action and can easily be referenced, reducing clutter.](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/General-Power-Automate/Approval-Flow-Tracked-Properties/td-p/237387)

### Action Headers Example

Consider the image below which shows capturing the status code and API throttle information for a List Records action in the **Common Data Service (current environment)** connector.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate//TrackedProps/TrackedProperties-ActionAndActions.JPG"  />

The example image below, where we are performing a 'List records' with the **Common Data Service** connector, now has a more **friendly way of tracking the response code and API throttling response**. This is a light weight example but should drive home the concept of **how, using Tracked Properties, I can now reference the "*TrackedPropertiesExample*" variable which now includes outputs from a previous action**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate//TrackedProps/TrackedProperties.CDS.Headers.JPG"  />

NOTE: A key point here is that the action function will work for tracking current action data but not previous actions with the actions function. Attempting to do so will result in the **"Tracked properties can only reference its own action's inputs and outputs, trigger inputs and outputs and parameters."** error.

### Timestamp Example

Using "**utcNow**()" as a tracked property for an action creates an interesting result. At first impression, we would be led to believe this may represent the start time of an action. However, when reviewing the output **this function actually produces the end time exactly as if we were to reference it from the output of the action**. Consider the below gif:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate//TrackedProps/TrackedProperties-UtcNow-EndTime.gif"  />

You can see that the five second delay is showing the tracked property "FiveSecondDelay" as the same timestamp as the endTime from the output!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate//TrackedProps/TrackedProperties-UtcNow-EndTimeCompareToStartTime.JPG"  />

Finally, as we look to **Azure Logic Apps** and what may come with **Microsoft Power Automate**, we can see how tracked properties work with monitoring solutions. **Azure Logic Apps** can [connect to Azure Log Analytics natively](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps-log-analytics) to log logic app runs. One way to extend the information stored in the log store is to [use Tracked Properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps-log-analytics#extend-data). 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate//TrackedProps/logic-app-run-details.png"  />

## Handling and Capturing Errors in Actions

Typically **Microsoft Power Automate** flows will fail out if an issue occurs. Manually we can review these failures in the Power Automate Portal or with PowerShell. However inside the Power Automate flow we have the ability to track the *statusCode* within the actions function. Along with the **Configure Run After** setting we can conditionally capture any error messages and report or store for analysis.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/MockError-HTTP-ConfigureRunAfter.JPG" />

**The Configure Run After setting allows the flow to continue if an error or timeout occurs**. This can be used in conjunction with the below image showing a conditional based on status code of a previous HTTP request output body:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/MockError-HTTP-Designer-Conditional.JPG" />

[This documentation from Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-exception-handling) does a great job detailing the "run after" behavior. Each action is marked with a status of "**Succeeded**", "**Failed**", "**Skipped**" or "**TimedOut**". The below image, from the Azure Logic App documentation, details how the "run after" behavior works in parallel branches.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/status-evaluation-for-parallel-branches.png"  />

### Retry Policies

Retry architectural patterns are nothing new in our continually evolving, interconnected world of dispersed systems. In [Robert Daigneau's excellent book "Service Design Patterns"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10917482-service-design-patterns), he goes into great detail discussing various patterns. One such example to handle errors when connecting and processing integration requests and responses involving retry is the [Idempotent Retry pattern](http://www.servicedesignpatterns.com/WebServiceInfrastructures/IdempotentRetry). (pgs 206 - 212).

In the case of **Microsoft Power Automate** and **Azure Logic Apps**, we have a feature called [Retry Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-exception-handling) which can be beneficial when working with integrations. Based on the status code returned (408, 429, 5xx, ect), the retry action can be configured to trigger a retry based on different intervals (Default, Exponential, Fixed). [The default policy is to send up to four retries scaled by 7.5 seconds.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-exception-handling)

### Mock Responses

[Integration actions can be simulate responses](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/test-logic-apps-mock-data-static-results) which can be helpful to troubleshoot without invoking a live system or for designing error handling.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/MockError-DevOps-StaticResult.JPG" />

**These simulated responses can be used, similar to mocks, when developing custom APIs and are quite useful when building custom connectors**. The response can be successful, error prone, time out prone, etc based on the scenario. A specific status code and response can be added to help troubleshoot these specific scenarios.

The image below shows setting up a failed mock response and the many different error codes. 

NOTE: **Depending on what connector you're using, you may not be able to use certain error codes.**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/MockResponses.VariousErrorCodesAndMessages.JPG"  />

The below image shows mocking a **Common Data Service** [API throttled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/api-limits#how-service-protection-api-limits-are-enforced) error response:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/MockResponses.Error.CDS.APIThrottled.JPG"  />

This image shows mocking a **Common Data Service** [Too Many Concurrent Requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/api-limits#service-protection-api-limit-errors-returned) error response:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/MockResponses.Error.CDS.ConcurrentRequests.JPG"  />

Finally, the below image shows the run history and capturing the error response from the **Common Data Service**:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/MockResponses.Error.CDS.ConcurrentRequests.Response.JPG" style="zoom: 80%;" />

### Throttling with Azure Logic Apps

Throttling in **Azure Logic Apps** has many facets and can stem from all sorts of potential areas. **Connectors can be throttled, destination APIs can be throttled** and depending if you're running in an **integration service environment (ISE)** or not can impact that. [Consider the following documentation in detail](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/handle-throttling-problems-429-errors) when deciding an implementation approach with **Azure Logic Apps**. Scenarios such as dealing with **Azure Service Bus queues** are thoroughly examined (e.g. **using nested logic apps...this technique will work for Microsoft Power Automate as well!**)

### Webhook Tester Site and runtime debugging

The below reference and steps are taken from the [**Azure Logic Apps** document "Diagnosing Failures"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-diagnosing-failures#perform-runtime-debugging). This technique of using **the Webhook Tester site for debugging run time integrations** is very useful. **An added benefit is that the Webhook Tester site allows for both cloud and local based (e.g. Docker containers, Virtual Machines, etc).**

*To help with debugging, you can add diagnostic steps to a logic app workflow, along with reviewing the trigger and runs history. For example, you can add steps that use the [Webhook Tester](https://webhook.site/) service so that you can inspect HTTP requests and determine their exact size, shape, and format.*

1. *Go to the [Webhook Tester](https://webhook.site/) site and copy the generated unique URL.*

2. *In your logic app, add an HTTP POST action plus the body content that you want to test, for example, an expression or another step output.*

3. *Paste your URL from Webhook Tester into the HTTP POST action.*

4. *To review how a request is formed when generated from the Logic Apps engine, run the logic app, and revisit the Webhook Tester site for more details.*

   [Perform runtime debugging]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-diagnosing-failures#perform-runtime-debugging	"Perform runtime debugging"

   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/Catch-Webhook-Tester-Site.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

For more information, [review the documentation here.](https://docs.webhook.site/)

**NOTE: This tool is useful for testing outside of Power Automate including any resource that has HTTP Post capabilities, examples including Azure Functions and GitHub Web hooks!**

### Scopes and the Try, Catch, Finally Pattern

[Using scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-exception-handling#evaluate-actions-with-scopes-and-their-results), actions can be [linked together](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-control-flow-run-steps-group-scopes) in a logical group allowing for evaluation of multiple actions as a whole. This comes into play when working with exception and error handling. Scopes provide statuses similar to **Power Automate** flows or **Logic Apps** themselves such as "**Succeeded**", "**Failed**", "**Cancelled**", etc. **Pieter Veenstra** has a really nice approach, "[Get the result of your failed actions in Power Automate](https://sharepains.com/2020/03/06/get-the-result-of-your-failed-actions/)" for using scopes to implement a **Try, Catch, Finally** pattern which i'll discuss below.

In the image below are three scope objects titled "**Try**", "**Catch**" and "**Finally**".

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/TryCatchFinallyPattern.JPG"  />

From a recent flow run, expanding the **Try** block, we can see two successful actions followed by our mocked failed response from the Common Data Service:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/Scopes.TryCatchExample.JPG"  />

The **Catch** scope underneath the **Try** scope is using the run after property of the Try scope to **<u>catch results with a status of "Failed"</u>**. If any actions inside the Try scope, at least how this example is configured, fails, the Catch scope will begin processing. The remaining actions within the Try scope are not processed.

Below is an image of **the Catch scope with Tracked Propertie**s:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/Action-Catch-TrackedProperties-Try.JPG"  />

To work with the Try scope within the Catch scope, we will **use the results function which provides context to what happened within the Try scope**.

### Result Function

The [results()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/workflow-definition-language-functions-reference#result) function, as shown in the reference link, **returns an array object**. At first glance this seems fairly straight forward until we dig deeper into the [context of the results output](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-exception-handling#get-results-from-failures). The actions returned with the results function [include the standard properties listed in Part 1](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---run-time-part-1-triggers-workflows-and-actions#actions) such as start and end time and tracking identifiers. You'll also see that they include properties indicating if they were successful or not. 

The image below shows a successful action named "successful_try_action" and a failed action named "Condition". Each action includes two properties, **code** and **message** that can be used [to filter the array](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-perform-data-operations#filter-array-action). The *successful action is in green while the failed action is in red*.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/ErrorHandling/Result-CatchMultipleTry-SuccessAndFailure.JPG"  />

Finally, the below gif shows **working with the Try, Catch, Finally pattern and scope and results objects to capture and report**. This technique can be continued to then **send data to Azure Application Insights or Azure Log Analytics** as briefly shown below. I'll cover this in an upcoming article!

## Next Steps

In this article we have discussed tracking properties across actions to help supplement reporting. When examining error handling and preparing for designing resilient **Microsoft Power Automate** flows we examined various patterns. Utilizing **retry policies**, configuring the **run after conditions** and **implementing scope** can all help build an enterprise ready flow. 

In previous articles, [we discussed how to **evaluate workflows, triggers and run functions to help deliver insights**](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---run-time-part-1-triggers-workflows-and-actions). In the following articles covering **Microsoft Power Automate Flow** run time, we will discuss **pushing events to Application Insights and reviewing previous flow runs for monitoring and governance**.
