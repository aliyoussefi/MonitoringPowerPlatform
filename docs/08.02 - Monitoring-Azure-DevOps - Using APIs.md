# Monitoring the Power Platform: Azure DevOps - Using the REST API and Scenarios

## Summary

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/) has become more and more ingrained into our **Power Platform** project lifecycle. Work item tracking and feedback tools for teamwork. Continuous integration and delivery for code changes and solution deployments. Automated testing for assurance, compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/#culture)** provides native capabilities to plan, work, collaborate and deliver. Each step along the way in our [**Power Platform DevOps** journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools) can be tracked and monitored which will be the primary objective of this article.

This article will focus on reviewing the current setup of our **Azure DevOps** implementation using APIs. We will **<u>work with environments and builds that can help to control and coordinate</u>**. From there, we will deep dive into <u>**build runs to capture work items and change information to help with annotation**</u>. We will explore **build timelines and logs, helping us determine where things may have gone wrong or could be tuned**. **<u>Finally, I'll provide references to useful REST API calls and PowerShell samples.</u>**

## Sources

Sources of **Azure DevOps** events that impact our delivery can come from virtually **<u>any area of the platform including work items, pipelines, source control, testing and artifact delivery</u>**. As mentioned, this article will focus on using the **Azure DevOps REST API** to expose these sources externally.

## Azure DevOps REST API

### Choosing between the SDK and invoking the endpoint directly

To connect to the **Azure DevOps REST API** an administrator can use [HTTP requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) directly or the [client library (SDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1#client-libraries). The SDK will **<u>help simplify your code and works across multiple frameworks include .NET, Node.js and Python</u>**. A [reference to the Azure DevOps Dot Net Sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-dotnet-samples) can be found on **GitHub**.

If you choose to not take on the dependency of the SDK the REST API can still be used and invoked. The decision here is how you plan to utilize your solution. If you are working within an **Azure Function** for instance, **<u>consider using the SDK</u>**. For workloads, such as **<u>Power Automate or PowerShell, I would recommend the REST API</u>**.

### Authenticating with a Personal Access Token or SSH

**Personal Access Tokens** are alternative passwords that allow **Azure DevOps** administrators to issue temporary access to trusted applications that wish to work with the REST API. To setup a PAT, please review [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).

For a detailed description of how to choose the right authentication mechanism, please go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/authentication-guidance?view=azure-devops). If you are working with a Linux container or environment continue using the SSH Keys.

### Components of a REST Request

#### The URL and API Versions

```
VERB https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis[/{area}]/{resource}?api-version={version}
```

You should leverage API versioning when working with REST APIs to avoid breaking changes. **Azure DevOps REST API** offers backwards compatibility with this approach. The API versioning reference is located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1#api-and-tfs-version-mapping). Its key to the subsequent calls below so be sure to make a point to review the reference regularly. 

**<u>NOTE</u>**: In the PowerShell examples provided below, I'll be providing **<u>a parameter approach for supplying the API version which is helpful to quickly update to a newer version</u>**.

#### Sample Request and Response

Below is an example using a HTTP request to list projects in the *contoso* organization:

Request:

```
GET https://dev.azure.com/contoso/_apis/projects?api-version=5.0 HTTP/1.1
authorization: Basic ***sanitizied***
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) WindowsPowerShell/5.1.18362.145
Content-Type: application/json
Host: dev.azure.com

```

Response:

```
{
  "count": 1,
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "<project guid>",
      "name": "<project name>",
      "url": "https://dev.azure.com/contoso/_apis/projects/{project guid}",
      "state": "wellFormed",
      "revision": 19,
      "visibility": "public",
      "lastUpdateTime": "2019-11-04T15:38:16.723Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Common Operations

The **Azure DevOps APIs** and SDK provide many different operations from project and user membership, to work items, source control, automation, testing and governance. Common operations of interest for monitoring include identifying the status of builds and deployments and capturing logs from pipelines and tasks which will be detailed below. 

## Build Environments
### Environments

**[Environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments?view=azure-devops)** in **Azure DevOps** allow for **<u>targeted deployment of artifacts to a collection of resources</u>**. In the case of the **Power Platform**, this can be thought of **<u>a release to an Power Platform environment</u>**. The use of pipeline environments is optional, that is unless you begin work using Release pipelines which do require environments. **<u>Two of the main advantages of environments are deployment history and security and permissions</u>**. Using the **[Azure DevOps REST API for Environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment%20records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0)** we can evaluate both...*mostly*.

Using the following **PowerShell** script we can extract information regarding an environment.

```
$environmentsUrl = "$($devopsBaseUrl)$($projectId)/_apis/distributedtask/environments?name=$($environmentNameEncoded)&$($apiVersion)"
$environments = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $environmentsUrl -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $header
```

The output for each environment includes the identifier, name, description and creation properties.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi.GetEnvironemnt.PowerShell.PNG"  />

#### Environment Deployment History and 

**Environments** allow **Azure DevOps** administrators the ability to review and manage each deployment. With this control also comes auditing of previous deployments allowing insight into trends and potential vulnerabilities. 

Each attempted deployment to an environment includes [an execution record](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment%20records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0#environmentdeploymentexecutionrecord) that can expose [stage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/stages?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) (*orchestrations and divisions of labor) and [job](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) (*sequential tasks*) details. Below is an example of a **PowerShell** script to request deployment records on a specific environment using the **[Environment Deployment Records REST API]()**.

```
$environmentDeploymentRecordsUrl = "$($devopsBaseUrl)$($projectId)/_apis/distributedtask/environments/$($envirommentId)/environmentdeploymentrecords?$($apiVersion)"
$environmentDeploymentRecords = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $environmentDeploymentRecordsUrl -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $header
```

For each deployment record we can find out a wealth of information. **<u>Build definitions, plans, stages, jobs are all shown</u>**. The **start and finish timings and statuses** are also shown, helping engineers determine where things may have gone wrong.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi.GetEnvironmentDeploymentRecord.PowerShell.PNG"  />

Here is an **example showing usage of the Environment and [Environment Deployment Record REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment%20records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0#environmentdeploymentexecutionrecord) calls**. Also included are calls to the **Build REST API calls detailed below**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/REST API and Build Environment Deployment.gif"  />

#### Quick Note on Security Checks

Each deployment, that meets security checks, will be included within the **[Execution Record REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment%20records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0#environmentdeploymentexecutionrecord)** result list. If the deployment is not found, most likely it is awaiting or failed a specific conditional check. As of this writing, the ability to read pending deployments awaiting checks such as approvals is not straight forward. 

That said, using **Web Hooks**, as discussed in the Web Hooks section of the article "", we can see acknowledgement of a pending approval. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/Environment.ApprovalCheck.WebHook.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />

In this scenario we can be notified, other checks currently do not allow for flexibility. Feel free to upvote this request to gain traction on adding this to the **Azure DevOps REST API**.

## Build Pipelines

As we continue the journey within the **Azure DevOps** service towards continuous integration we will begin using **Azure DevOps Build Pipelines** more and more. Pipelines allow tight control and visibility into pretty much all aspects of the service. This includes work item and code changes that resulted in integration and deployment. 

Each build can be drilled into using the **Azure DevOps REST API** to find out about all our builds. This allows us to request for each build, not only the logs and timings, but how the build compares to previous builds. From this we can conclude if our builds are trending in the right direction and if not, what can we do to course correct.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi.Sources.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />



Using the following **PowerShell** command, we can review the status of any particular build of interest. For the below example, I had previously scanned the [**Build Definition** REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/build/definitions/get?view=azure-devops-rest-6.1) for builds.

```
$buildUrl = "$($devopsBaseUrl)$($projectId)/_apis/build/builds/$($buildId)?api-version=5.1-preview.2";
$build = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $buildChangesUrl -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $header
```

Here is the output:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi.GetBuild.Output.PNG"  />

In the above example, we can see that **<u>the build number, the status and result, the start and finish times are returned</u>**. Also included is **information about the code changes and work items as well as logs** that can be drilled into for each task.

#### Build Changes and Work Items

Each build mostly likely is associated with changes made by a team of developers or support engineers. **<u>During the typical DevOps process, branches are created, code is crafted and merged with Pull Requests</u>**. Below is an example of a sample commit and pull request triggering a build.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi.GetBuildChanges.DevOpsGUI.PNG"  />

With the **Azure DevOps REST API**, we can review the location and identifiers to help monitor the code changes in each build. 

```
$buildChangesUrl = "$($devopsBaseUrl)$($projectId)/_apis/build/builds/$($buildId)/changes?api-version=5.1-preview.2";
$buildChanges = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $buildChangesUrl -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $header
```

**PowerShell** example output:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi.GetBuildChanges.PowerShell.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />

This is essential to helping automate release notes that include references to each commit and approval. Post deployment, analysts can review and determine gaps in the current process. **<u>This feedback loop is important to internal teams to continuous improve and optimize the code delivery process.</u>**

#### Build Work Items

Each build also brings along information about each work item associated to it. This can include user stories and bugs associated within a Release Record for each release. **<u>By using Web Hooks and the REST API, we can review and provide automated release records to external stakeholders such as users of our platform.</u>**

Here is a sample **PowerShell** script requesting associated work item referenced in a build run.

```
$buildWorkItemsUrl = "$($devopsBaseUrl)$($projectId)/_apis/build/builds/$($buildId)/workitems?api-version=5.1-preview.2";
$buildWorkItems = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $buildWorkItemsUrl -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $header
```

### Artifacts

Each build can contain artifacts that can be retained and used by other builds, included in documentation or packaged as part of a release using **[the Artifacts REST API call]()**. 

Here is sample **PowerShell** script showing how to request the published artifacts from a build run.

```
$buildArtifactsUrl = "$($devopsBaseUrl)$($projectId)/_apis/build/builds/$($buildId)/artifacts?api-version=5.1-preview.2";
$buildArtifacts = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $buildArtifactsUrl -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $header
```

Here's the output in **PowerShell**. Reference the "***downloadUrl***" to extract and store the published artifacts to external services such as **Azure Blob Storage**. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi.GetBuildArtifacts.PowerShell.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Logs

Gathering build logs are important, **<u>allowing administrators to track the status, the timings and the actions performed by a build</u>**. Within each build, logs are collected for every action, which can be extracted using the "***logs.url***" property within the [**Build REST API command**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/build/Builds/Get?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1). Using the [**Get Build Log REST API**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/build/builds/get%20build%20log?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) we can expand each and review or store in another log store such as **Azure Application Insights**.

Here is a sample **PowerShell** script that loops through each log URL in a build and prints the content.

```
$buildTaskLogs = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $build.logs.url -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $header
$buildTaskLogs.value | ForEach-Object{
    #get the log payload of each task log in a build
    $log = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $_.url -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $header
    Write-Host $log
}
```

## Next Steps

In this article we have worked with **Azure DevOps** externally. Using the SDK or REST API, **Azure DevOps** can be explored in detail, allowing us to reimagine how we consume and work with the service.

Previously we looked at setting up notifications and web hooks to popular services. Continuing from here, we will look into more collaboration opportunities. We will review Chat Bots and integrations with **Microsoft Teams**. For deployment tracking, we will dive into build and release events and opportunities to analyze for greater insights into trends.
