# Monitoring the Power Platform: Azure DevOps - Using the REST API and Scenarios

## Summary

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/) has become more and more ingrained into our **Power Platform** project lifecycle. Work item tracking and feedback tools for teamwork. Continuous integration and delivery for code changes and solution deployments. Automated testing for assurance, compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/#culture)** provides native capabilities to plan, work, collaborate and deliver. Each step along the way in our [**Power Platform DevOps** journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools) can be tracked and monitored which will be the primary objective of this article.

This article will focus on feedback, specifically from events that happen with **Azure DevOps**. We will first look at subscription setup and notifications to team members and interested parties. From there we will dive deeper into feedback events, how they work, how they can be filtered and delivered. Finally we will review a real world example utilizing service hooks, **Power Automate** and **Microsoft Teams**.

## Sources

Sources of Azure DevOps events that impact our delivery can come from virtually any area of the platform including work items, pipelines, source control, testing and artifact delivery. For each one of these events, such as completed work items, we can setup visualizations such as charts based on defined queries. Service hooks and notification subscriptions can be configured to allow real time reporting of events to external parties and systems allowing for us to stay in a state of continuous communication and collaboration.

## Azure DevOps REST API

### Choosing between the SDK and invoking the endpoint directly

To connect to the Azure DevOps REST API an administrator can use [HTTP requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) directly or the [client library (SDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1#client-libraries). 

To work with the SDK you can leverage SOAP or REST requests, its recommended to use [the RESTful libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/dotnet-client-libraries?view=azure-devops). The SDK will help simplify your code and works across multiple frameworks include .NET, Node.js and Python. A [reference to the Azure DevOps Dot Net Sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-dotnet-samples) can be found on GitHub.

If you choose to not take on the dependency of the SDK the REST API can still be used and invoked. The decision here is how you plan to utilize your REST API solution and which solution fits best.

### Authenticating with a Personal Access Token or SSH

Personal Access Token are alternative passwords that allow DevOps administrators to issue temporary access to trusted applications that wish to work with the REST API. To setup a PAT, please review [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/_shared/_img/my-profile-team-services-preview.png?view=azure-devops)

For a detailed description of how to choose the right authentication mechanism, please go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/authentication-guidance?view=azure-devops). If you are working with a Linux container or environment continue using the SSH Keys.

### Components of a REST Request

#### The URL and API Versions

```
VERB https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis[/{area}]/{resource}?api-version={version}
```

You should leverage API Versioning when working with REST APIs to avoid breaking changes. Azure DevOps REST API offers backwards compatibility with this approach. Below are some of the versions you can use:

- `api-version=1.0`
- `api-version=1.2-preview`
- `api-version=2.0-preview.1`

API Versioning Reference is located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1#api-and-tfs-version-mapping).

#### Request Header and Body

A HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, etc) can be used and most of the time a bearer token will be needed as well that will be passed in with an Authorization header. Please reference the "*Authenticating with a Personal Access Token or SSH*" area to learn how to generate this token. MIME encoding maybe needed (i.e. application/json) and can be added with the content-type header.

#### Sample Request and Response

Below is an example using PowerShell to list projects in the *contoso* organization:

Request:

```
GET https://dev.azure.com/contoso/_apis/projects?api-version=5.0 HTTP/1.1
authorization: Basic ***sanitizied***
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) WindowsPowerShell/5.1.18362.145
Content-Type: application/json
Host: dev.azure.com

```

Response:

```
{
  "count": 1,
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "<project guid>",
      "name": "<project name>",
      "url": "https://dev.azure.com/contoso/_apis/projects/{project guid}",
      "state": "wellFormed",
      "revision": 19,
      "visibility": "public",
      "lastUpdateTime": "2019-11-04T15:38:16.723Z"
    }
  ]
}
```



### Common Operations

The Azure DevOps APIs and SDK provide the ability many different operations to retrieve information from project and user membership, work items, source control, automation, testing and governance. Common operations of interest for monitoring include identifying statuses and metrics of builds, capturing logs from pipelines and tasks and auditing of user membership and policies. 



When creating the subscription, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First only project administrators will have access to edit and view subscriptions by default. This can be adjusted to grant privileges  to other users. Also, specific actions may be limited depending on which event type is chosen.[Create a service hooks subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/create-subscription?view=azure-devops) programmatically.

#### DevOps Subscription REST API

Common operations performed with the REST API include configuring a subscription and getting list of publishers. The [Replace Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/hooks/subscriptions/replace%20subscription?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) is handy for updating the subscription for example of a WebHook service hook allowing to programmatically reconfigure the url to a local service for testing (e.g. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/product)).



Create https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/hooks/notifications/create?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1



#### DevOps REST API

The Azure DevOps REST API provides the ability to configure [notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/notification/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) and [subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/notification/subscriptions?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) and review [diagnostics logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/notification/diagnostic%20logs/list?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1). Diagnostic logs are useful to troubleshoot what notifications were sent and if there were issues with the delivery.

## Pipelines
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi.Sources.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Environments

[Environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments?view=azure-devops) in Azure DevOps allow for targeted deployment of artifacts to a collection of resources. In the case of the Power Platform, this can be thought of a release to an Power Platform environment. The use of pipeline environments is optional, that is unless you begin work using Release pipelines which do require environments. Two of the main advantages of environments are deployment history and security and permissions. Using the [Azure DevOps REST API for Environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment%20records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0) we can evaluate both...mostly.

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment%20records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0)

#### Deployment History and Security Checks

Environments allow DevOps administrators the ability to review and manage deployments. With this control also comes auditing of previous deployments allowing insight into trends and potential vulnerabilities. Each attempted deployment to an environment includes [an execution record](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment%20records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0#environmentdeploymentexecutionrecord) that can expose [stage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/stages?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) (orchestrations and divisions) and [job](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) (sequential tasks) details.

<insert execution record image>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/ADO.Areas.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Each deployment, that meets security checks, will be included within the execution record REST API list. If the deployment is not found, most likely it is awaiting or failed a specific conditional check. As of this writing, the ability to read pending deployments awaiting checks such as approvals is not straight forward. That said, using Web Hooks, as discussed in the Web Hooks section of the article "", we can see acknowledgement of a pending approval. In this scenario we can be notified, other checks currently do not allow for flexibility. Feel free to upvote this request to gain traction on adding this to the REST API.

### Builds

Build Pipeline has capabilities to review analytics from an API. This allows us to request for each build not only the logs and timings but how the build compares to previous builds. From this we can conclude if our builds are trending in the right direction and if not, what can we do to course correct.

### Logs

Gathering build logs are important to allow administrators to track the status, the timings and the actions performed by a build. Within each build, logs are collected for every action, which can be extracted using the getbuildlog REST API command.

## Next Steps

In this article we have the beginning stages of collecting and distributing feedback for our teams and stakeholders. Email notifications based on work item updates and code changes allow specific teams to quickly respond to changes. Service hooks allow for events to be sent to first and third party integrations. Web hooks allow for complete flexibility, delivering stateful messages to HTTP endpoint subscribers.

Continuing from here, we will explore the Azure DevOps REST API and specific actions that can be useful for tracking changes. For collaboration, we will review Chat Bots and integrations with Microsoft Teams. For deployment tracking, we will dive into build and release events and opportunities to analyze for greater insights into trends.
