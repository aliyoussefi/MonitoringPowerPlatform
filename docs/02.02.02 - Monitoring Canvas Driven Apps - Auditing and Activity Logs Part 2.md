# Monitoring the Power Platform: Canvas Apps - Auditing and Activity Logs Part 2

## Summary

**Microsoft Power Apps Canvas Apps** provide users the ability to quickly create and publish applications to their enterprise. With this ability comes concerns with governance to ensure users are allowed the appropriate permissions as well as identifying and highlighting specific apps across the organization.

This article will build off of **Canvas Apps - Auditing and Activity Part 1** to examine how to **search and store audit and activity logs** for **Canvas Apps**. This includes how to turn on auditing, how to use the **Office 365 Compliance Portal**, the **Unified Audit Log PowerShell command** and the **Office 365 Management Activity API**. We will conclude with thoughts on monitoring tools such as **Azure Sentinel**, and storage tools such as **Cosmos DB** and **Azure Blob Storage**.

## Searching the Unified Audit Log

**Searching** the **Unified Audit Log** can be performed both **manually** and with **automation**. Manually there is a portal called the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Center Portal** that provides a **centralized area for auditing all Office 365 services including the Power Platform**. If automation is desired the **Unified Audit Log offers both a PowerShell module and an API** which can be subscribed to. This section covers all three of these in detail. 

## The Office 365 Security and Compliance Center Portal

### Accessing the Office 365 Audit Reports

To begin using the **Office 365 Unified Audit Log**, your organization will need to have [at minimum a specific Office 365 or Microsoft 365 license](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide#before-you-begin). Currently the license if the **E3 license**. The type of license will impact the retention of the logs, **E3 is for 90 days** while the **E5 license retains for a year** by default. [To turn on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off?view=o365-worldwide), click the "**Turn on auditing**" button. If an error message occurs, most likely its due to licensing.

Users will need to be an Office 365 Global Administrator or be a member of one or more Security and Compliance Center role groups. [To provide a user access to the Security and Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center?view=o365-worldwide), use the **Office 365 Admin Center** and open the Admin center for Compliance. Alternatively, you can directly access the permissions page from [here](https://protection.office.com/permissions). The permission needed is "**View-Only Audit Logs**" or "**Audit Logs**" which allows for viewing and exporting of audit reports.

### Navigating the Office 365 Compliance Center Portal

The **Office 365 Security and Compliance Center** found at https://protection.office.com can be used by security analysts to manually search for specific events using a portal user interface. 

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/media/audit-log-search-pa.png)

As shown in the image above, a single action or multiple activities for **Canvas App** can be chosen for analysis. To begin our search, [run an audit log search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide#search-the-audit-log) by specifying the activities, the time range and optional search parameters such as users or site. Once the search is complete, [review the results](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide#step-2-view-the-search-results) in the portal. **<u>The results are maxed out at the most 5000 newest events and are incremented 150 records at a time.</u>**

Below is an image showing a drill down into the **Launched app** audit record.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/UnifiedAuditLog/CanvasApps/CanvasApp.Portal.LaunchedApp.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Here is an image showing where I edited the App permissions to allow Everyone in my organization access to view:



The Object Id within **Azure Active Directory**:

### PowerShell

For **PowerShell** the ***Search-UnifiedAuditLog***, part of the **Exchange Online PowerShell V2** module, is used for **Office 365** services including **Power Apps Canvas and Model Driven Apps**. For **Canvas Apps** there exist a record type called "**PowerAppsApp**" that will scope to only logs from **Canvas Apps**. Using the same table above, here are the **PowerShell** Operation equivalents to each captured event:

| Event                  | PowerShell Operation      |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Created app            | CreatePowerApp            |
| Launched app           | LaunchPowerApp            |
| Marked app as Featured | MarkPowerAppAsFeatured    |
| Restored app version   | PromotePowerAppVersion    |
| Edited app             | UpdatePowerApp            |
| Published app          | PublishPowerApp           |
| Edited app permission  | PowerAppPermissionEdited  |
| Deleted app            | DeletePowerApp            |
| Marked app as Hero     | MarkPowerAppAsHero        |
| Deleted app permission | PowerAppPermissionDeleted |

To use the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog**, connect using the **Connect-ExchangeOnline** cmdlet. This is a replacement for using the **New-PSSession**, however currently creating this session will also work.

```
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement  

$UserCredential = Get-Credential
Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $UserCredential
```

<u>NOTE: Please refer to the section "**Important Notes on the Exchange Online Module**" for important authentication considerations.</u>

The below **PowerShell** command uses the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog** to search for any activities related to Canvas Apps. To specify this, use the -**RecordType** argument with the value "**PowerAppsApp**".

```
$endDate = Get-Date
$startDate = $endDate.AddDays(-7) #Search last 7 days
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -RecordType PowerAppsApp
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/CanvasApps/UnifiedAuditLog-Examples.JPG)

As the image above shows, this will bring back all activities related to **Canvas Apps**. Depending on what type of audit record you're looking for, the search can be filtered using the **Operation** argument.

Example of searching for **Canvas App** creation events:

```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -RecordType PowerAppsApp -Operation "CreatePowerApp"
```

Example of searching for **Canvas App** launch events:

```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -RecordType PowerAppsApp -Operation "LaunchPowerApp"
```

Each operation can also be filtered down to the specific user using the **-UserIds** argument. Consider the below script for **filtering launch events for a specific user**:

```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -UserIds "user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com" -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -RecordType "PowerAppsApp" -Operations "LaunchPowerApp"
```

Each record returned includes the data of the audit, the user and the data collected within the ***AuditData*** property. The **app and environment properties** are available within this property which can be **extracted and stored for contextual information to a log data store**. For help working with the ***AuditData*** property, consider using with the "[**ConvertFrom-Json**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/convertfrom-json?view=powershell-7)" cmdlet.

```
$AuditData = ConvertFrom-Json -InputObject $_.AuditData
```



**Azure Automation** allows for the use of running PowerShell runbooks in Azure. Here is an example image of the output from running the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog** in **Azure Automation**:

One of the benefits of **Azure Automation** is the ability to schedule the execution of our script. The image below shows the recurrence based on a schedule created.

Another benefit is the native integration with **Azure Log Analytics.** This integration will come in handy further in this article.

### Important Notes on the Exchange Online Module

NOTE: I want to point out [verbiage that exists on the Search-UnifiedAuditLog page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-audit/search-unifiedauditlog?view=exchange-ps#description) referring to programmatically downloading data from the audit log:

If you want to programmatically download data from the **Office 365 Audit Log**, we recommend that you use the **Office 365 Management Activity API** instead of using the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog** cmdlet in a **PowerShell** script. The **Office 365 Management Activity API** is a REST web service that you can use to develop operations, security, and compliance monitoring solutions for your organization. For more information, see [Office 365 Management Activity API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference).

<u>The above is important to point out that the current **Exchange Online** modules rely on Basic authentication</u>. This is a major concern as it requires either a user to interactively login or to supply credentials as a username and password stored somewhere like **Azure Key Vault**.

### Office 365 Management Activity API

Another way to automate delivery of audit data is by use of the **Office 365 Management Activity API**. [To being using the API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/get-started-with-office-365-management-apis), an App Registration needs to be created in **Azure Active Directory**. The App Registration will need to have permissions to the **Office 365 Management APIs**, scoped to the **ActivityFeed.Read** permission. Once created, the App Registration can be used to get an access token for working with the API subscriptions and blobs. The below image shows the authentication flow and a single request to the API.

![Management APIs getting started authorization flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/images/authorization-flow.png)

Now that the authentication mechanism is in place, we will have to tell the **Office 365 Management API** which activities we are interested in. This, in my opinion, is where I hope to see the API achieve filter parity with the **PowerShell** or **Portal** for the **Unified Audit Log**. For **Power Apps Canvas Apps**, there is no way to [filter to the specific workload](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference#working-with-the-office-365-management-activity-api) like what is available in the **Portal** or through **PowerShell**. This means we have to subscribe to a general bucket of events called **Audit.General**.

To get the authorization token and create the subscription I used **Postman**. I've included my sample **Postman** collection here which shows how to **get an authorization token**, to **start a subscription**, as well as **poll for notifications**.

As stated in the documentation, **a subscription needs to be created for *Audit.General***. Each tenant you intend to monitor will need its own subscription. Once created, the subscription can be used to poll for events or as a **webhook** to have notification delivered when events are ready. <u>NOTE: Subscriptions can take up to 12 hours before the content blobs are available.</u>

For the **webhook** I followed a [really great article by Amreek Singh](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/2019/06/18/storing-common-data-service-activity-logs-outside-of-office-365/) that covers how to setup a **subscription** and **webhook** to deliver to **Cosmos DB** for storing and analysis. Included in his article are **Power Automate flow** examples that can be used to learn more. The example does not include the authorization token and I'm including this as an addition to his flows.

![Solution Architecture 2](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/uploads/prod/sites/4/2019/06/Solution-Architecture-2-1024x165.png)

When receiving a notification, an array of content blobs will be delivered. Here's an example of a content blob notification:

    {
        "contentUri": "https://manage.office.com/api/v1.0/1557f771-4c8e-4dbd-8b80-dd00a88e833e/activity/feed/audit/<identifier>$audit_general$Audit_General$na0045",
        "contentId": "<identifier>$audit_general$Audit_General$na0045",
        "contentType": "Audit.General",
        "contentCreated": "2020-04-20T21:43:05.262Z",
        "contentExpiration": "2020-04-27T21:40:03.973Z"
    }
From what I've seen, each blob contains around 10-15 minutes worth of audits but this could vary depending on the activity captured. Below is an image of the frequency of delivery to the **webhook** to my **flow**.

## Managing, Archiving and Retaining Events

Utilizing **Azure Log Analytics** or **Azure Application Insights** offers native integration with additional monitoring tools to help detect anomalies. Tools such as [**Azure Sentinel**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview), offering a Security Information Event Management ([**SIEM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management)) and Security Orchestration Automated Response (**SOAR**), or [**Azure Monitoring**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview), offering analysis detection solutions, are perfect for this.

<sentinel image>

As stated above, based on the license type, audit logs are retained from 90 days to one year. However, business requirements may dictate a long term solution that could cover multiple years of audit activity.  Regardless which mechanism to extract data, be it from the Portal or through PowerShell or the API, archiving these audits is a key requirement for most organizations. Each of these tools provide us capabilities to integrate these logs into a centralized data store such as **Azure Blob Storage** or **Cosmos DB** for long term retention.

This topic has a considerable amount of impact in your organization's strategy. A future article will cover this topic in more detail, and when published, I'll link from here.

## Advanced Audit in Microsoft 365

A recent addition to the compliance tooling within Office 365 is the [**Advanced Audit**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/advanced-audit?view=o365-worldwide) feature. Currently I do not see anything specific to the **Power Platform** but this may change in the future. The key call out I see from the documentation is the ability to [retain audit logs from one year](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/advanced-audit?view=o365-worldwide#long-term-retention-of-audit-logs) and the [high bandwidth accessibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/advanced-audit?view=o365-worldwide#high-bandwidth-access-to-the-office-365-management-activity-api) for the **Office 365 Management Activity API**.

The other call out, is the throttling which is capped at **2,000 requests per minute**.

## Next Steps

In this article we have covered the **Unified Audit Logs** and what activities are currently captured for **Power Apps Canvas Apps**. Discussed were techniques to view the audit logs within the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Portal** as well as automated techniques using **subscriptions** and **webhooks** as well as **automating PowerShell using Azure Automation**. <u>Consider the combination of using the **Unified Audit Log** to notify of events happening and the **Power App Administration** cmdlets to apply security and enrich audits from the audit log.</u>

This article is designed to supplement the article on **Power App Analytics**, which provides more of an all up view of **Canvas App** usage. Combining these two documents, an administrator can now <u>track analytic metrics as well as the events that define those metrics</u>.
