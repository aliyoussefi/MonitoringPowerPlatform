# Monitoring the Power Platform: Power Virtual Agents - Analytics

## Summary

**Power Virtual Agents** empowers teams to easily create powerful bots using a guided, no-code graphical interface without the need for data scientists or developers. Power Virtual Agents addresses many of the major issues with bot building in the industry today. It eliminates the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams building the bots, and the long latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address it. It removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code. And, it minimizes the IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution.

Using Power Virtual Agents, you can:

- **Empower your teams** by allowing them to easily build bots themselves without needing intermediaries, or coding or AI expertise.
- **Reduce costs** by easily automating common inquiries and freeing human agent time to deal with more complex issues.
- **Improve customer satisfaction** by allowing customers to self-help and resolve issues quickly 24/7 using rich personalized bot conversations.

## Power Virtual Agent Analytics

### Power Virtual Agent Analytics in the Virtual Agent Home Page



#### Who can access this data?

From what I have seen, if you have the [appropriate licensing as a user within your tenant.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/requirements-licensing) to access the management portal for Power Virtual Agents you can view analytics.



#### Navigating the Portal

With the appropriate permissions, an admin will land on the **Usage** report for Power Apps Analytics.

#### Power Automate Reports

**Bot Performance and Usage**

Review overall analytics for your bots.

Summary

##### **<u>Engagement over time</u>**

An engaged session represents a session in which a specific user created topic was triggered. This metric also includes when a session is ended resulting in an escalation regardless if the Transfer to Agent is turned on or not.



##### **<u>Session outcomes</u>**

##### **<u>Resolution Rate</u>**

##### <u>Escalation Rate</u>

##### <u>Abandon Rate</u>

**The Abandon rate chart** 

The **Abandon rate drivers chart** is useful for admins to see which topics are being abandoned at what rate percentage. Within this chart an admin can drill down to a specific topic by clicking the **Detail** link which will route to **the Topic Analytics report**.

**Customer Satisfaction**

Identify overall trends in customer satisfaction, and where satisfaction is falling behind.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/analytics-csat

**Topic Usage**

See how individual topics are doing and how well they're working at resolving issues.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/analytics-topic-details

**Session Information**

Review and monitor how sessions are doing, including analytics from the topics triggered during a session.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/analytics-sessions

**Billed Session Information**

Understand how sessions are being billed, based on their usage.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/analytics-billed-sessions

#### Filtering the data returned

The Power Automate Analytics will show environments an admin has access to review data for. During acceptance or end to end testing, admins may want to focus on a specific environment and time range. [To do this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-powerapps#how-do-i-change-environments), click the "**Change filters**" button for any dashboard.

#### Export data for Analysis

Currently the ability to export from the **Power Platform Admin Center** is not available as it is with the **Common Data Service for Analytics**. I would expect this to change and will update this article once more information is available. Until then [**most charts can be exported via the ellipsis**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-flow#download-reports) like other **Microsoft Power BI** reports.

## Service Health within the Power Platform Admin Center

Recently announced in the **Release Wave 1 for 2020** is a [unified service health experience within the Power Platform Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform-release-plan/2020wave1/power-platform-governance-administration/unified-service-health-experience-power-platform-admin-center). This will allow admins the ability to focus efforts within the **Power Platform Admin Center**, not having to navigate to the **Office 365 Portal** for service health. This reduces Environment Admins from potentially interacting with Office 365 items and to focus on the **Power Platform** specifically. [According to the article the ability to set up alerts for service outages will be coming as part of the September 2020 general availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform-release-plan/2020wave1/power-platform-governance-administration/service-health-power-platform-admin-center).

## My Flow Analytics

[Announced in 2017](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-microsoft-flow-analytics/), **Microsoft Flows Analytics** today are useful for makers who want to review the flows created in the **My Flows area of the Maker Portal**. To view these analytics, navigate to the **My Flows** area and select a flow. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomateAnalytics/MyFlows-navigateTo.JPG" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Once the **Overview window** opens, in the toolbar click the **Analytics** button.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomateAnalytics/MyFlows-analyticsButton.JPG" style="zoom: 67%;" />

**The Usage report** shows **total runs by day**, **number of runs** and **trending flow runs**. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomateAnalytics/3-Flowanalytics.png" style="zoom: 67%;" />

**The Errors report** shows **errors by day**, **errors by type** and **error details** which can all be filtered by a specific action in you flow.

## Next Steps

**Power Automate Analytics** is a powerful tool enabling administrators to view a wealth of information across environments for the **Power Automate** platform. These analytics can show trends and alert for issues that need further investigation. Continuing this series, we will examine further tools and mechanisms that help us better understand both user activity and how to monitor and troubleshoot individual flow runs.
