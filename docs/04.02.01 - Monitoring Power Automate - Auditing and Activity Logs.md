# Monitoring the Power Platform: Power Automate - Auditing and Activity Logs Part 1

## Summary

[**Microsoft Power Automate**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/getting-started) provides users the ability to quickly create and integrate applications within the enterprise. With this ability comes concerns with governance to ensure users are allowed the appropriate permissions as well as identifying specific connections created and shared across the organization. **Power Automate Flows** offer a wide array of connectors and the ability to identify which of these are used and the connections created is essential to applying security policies to the **Power Platform**. 

This article begins by discussing the concept of **solution aware flows**. After that, we will briefly touch on the **Power Automate** admin connectors available for both **Power Automate Flows**. Tool sets for **PowerShell** will be explored that allow administrators tight control and visibility across a tenant. Finally the audited events for **Power Automate** will be detailed which will lead us into the **Office 365 Security and Compliance** topic.

## Differences between My Flows and Solution Flows

Before getting into the different flow events that can be managed and reported on, we need to first address  the differences between **My Flows** and Flows that are contained within a solution. **My Flows** are created in the https://flow.microsoft.com portal and <u>reside within the environment the maker created them in</u>. **Flows within solutions**, have similar characteristics as **My Flows** but **reside within a Common Data Service solution**. These are called "**<u>solution aware flows</u>**". The distinction may seem small at first but actually has a big impact into what we can do as both makers and admins.

<u>My Flows:</u>

<u>Solution Aware Flows:</u>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/PowerAutomate/SolutionAwareFlows.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Reviewing the article **[Power Automate Analytics](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---power-automate-analytics)**, we begin to see where differences in reporting and even the tools we can use differ between the two. In that article, the analytics reported from either a **My Flow** or a **solution aware flow** show much different level or insight. Each flow within a solution can be viewed across an environment while **My Flows** are shown individually.

For tooling, **My Flows** do not have a concept of using the **Common Data Service's current environment** as shown in **Aaron Richards'** article "**[Using the Common Data Service (Current Environment) Power Automate Connector](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/using-the-common-data-service-current-environment-power-automate-connector)**". As the article showcases, utilizing the **Common Data Service current environment connector** allows for actions such as **bound and unbound actions**, utilizing **FetchXml** and other **Dynamics 365** or **Model Driven App** concepts.

Another very important piece to point out is [**Application Lifecycle Management with Flows**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/overview-solution-flows). As an enterprise utilizing flows in a production ready environment, administrators will want **automation tools to migrate changes from developers**. **<u>Solution aware flows, as part of a Common Data Service solution, can be neatly packaged and moved across sandbox and test environments towards production.</u>** They also can leverage existing tools such as [**Solution Packager**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/compress-extract-solution-file-solutionpackager) to unpack and store within source control.

Finally, solution aware flows allow administrators the ability to use additional **API** and **PowerShell** commands to report and manage flow and <u>individual flow runs</u>. This article continues down this path as we explore the **Power Apps Connectors** and **Power Apps PowerShell** commands.

## Quick Note on Connectors and Connections

The connection and connectors actions for **Power Automate** include the **Power Automate Management** and **Power Automate for Flow connectors**. **Connectors** represent what can be connected to with a **Power Automate Flow** or **Power Apps Canvas App**. For this article just be aware that administrators can list all available connectors and connections or get a specific connector and connection.

[**Data Loss Prevention Policies**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention) need to also be briefly mentioned here as well as they are useful for restricting access to connectors in your enterprise. As detailed in "**[Introducing HTTP and Custom Connector Support for Data Loss Prevention Policies](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-http-and-custom-connector-support-for-data-loss-prevention-policies/)**" by **[Jonathon Levesque](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/author/jolevesq/)**, these policies can be used for HTTP and Custom Connectors as well as other First and Third party integrations. A deep dive into **DLP Policies** will be included in the [**Connectors and Connections article**](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate--connectors-and-connections).

Some of the **PowerShell** tasks addressed below are part of the connectors while others are not currently available. Consider the use of both the **PowerShell module for Power Apps Administration tasks** as well as the **Power Automate Management** and **Admin Connectors** as part of your governance strategy. A good article to review for this is "**[Power platform Security & Governance: Deploying a Defense in Depth Strategy](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/security-governance-strategy/)**" by **[Kent Weare](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/author/keweare/)**.

## Power Apps Administration PowerShell Tasks

The **PowerShell module for Power Apps Administration tasks** is an extremely useful way to view and take action on **environments**, **apps**, **flows**, **connectors** and **permissions**. The **PowerShell Support for Power Apps** page [contains a list of common operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#environments-commands) an administrator would find useful for governing an organization's use of the **Power Platform** and its environments. Some commands I'd like to call out are:

| Command                                              | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Get-AdminDlpPolicy                                   | Displays all of the Data Loss Prevention Policies            |
| Remove-AllowedConsentPlans                           | Can be used to remove the ability for uses to create trial licenses.<br />NOTE: It is important to note that when using *Remove-AllowedConsentPlans* all existing plans of the specified type will be removed from all users in the tenant and will not be recoverable. |
| Set-AdminPowerAppEnvironmentConnectionRoleAssignment | Update connection permissions                                |
| Set-AdminFlowOwnerRole                               | Changes the owner of a Power Automate Flow. Again, useful for reassignment. |
| Get-AdminFlowUserDetails                             | Read a user's Power Automate settings, which are not visible to user, but that support flow execution |
| Get-AdminPowerAppConnector                           | Returns a list of all custom connector details in the tenant. |

The "**Get**" cmdlets can all be used for **reporting and logging of the current state of an environment**. The below command from the examples on the **Power Apps PowerShell** page shows how to use the **Export-Csv** cmdlet with the **-Path** argument to **write to a text file**. In this example, we will get all flows in an environment.

```
Get-AdminFlow | Export-Csv -Path '.\FlowExport.csv'
```

With the **Get-AdminFlow** command below, we are filtering for flows with the word "*Approval*" in the title.

```
Get-AdminFlow -EnvironmentName '{Environment Name}' *Approval*
```

To view a specific user's flows across all environments, use the **Get-FlowOwnerRole** command:

```
Get-FlowOwnerRole -PrincipalObjectId '{userId}'
```

Consider the use of these commands with techniques discussed in *[Part 2 of Power Automate - Auditing and Activity Logs](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---auditing-and-activity-logs-part-2)* for additional logging capabilities.

## Activity Events for Power Automate

### What events are audited?

The events audited by the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Center** allow for administrators to search across multiple services offered including **Power Automate**. These **logs are collected at the SDK layer**, meaning one action can actually trigger multiple event logs in the log store. Events collected include flow lifecycle actions such as when an flow is **created**, **edited** or **deleted**. User actions include **modifying permissions** or **working with paid trials**.

#### Common Audit Properties

Each audit record includes common properties that can be used to help search or even correlate events together. Fields such as **precise time stamps**, the **specific Power Automate Flow**, the **operation performed** and **Identity of the record**. The **Identity** value is key as it can help us better understand a chain of events. 

| Field name      | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date            | Date and time of when the log was generated in UTC           |
| App Name        | Unique Identifier of the Flow                                |
| Id              | Unique GUID for every row logged                             |
| Result Status   | Status of the row logged. Success in most cases.             |
| Organization Id | Unique identifier of the organization from which the log was generated. |
| CreationTime    | Date and time of when the log was generated in UTC           |
| Operation       | Name of operation                                            |
| UserKey         | Unique Identifier of the User in Azure AD                    |
| UserType        | The audit type (Admin, Regular, System)                      |
| Additional Info | Additional information if any (e.g. the environment name)    |

#### List of Events

The article, [Microsoft Flow audit events now available in Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/security-and-compliance-center/), by [**Kent Weare**](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---auditing-and-activity-logs-part-2) explains the various activities that are audited for **Power Automate Flows**. It also goes into the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Center** discussed in [Part 2](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---auditing-and-activity-logs-part-2).

| Created flow         | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Created flow         | Creating a flow                          |
| Edited flow          | Updating a flow                          |
| Deleted flow         | Removing a flow                          |
| Edited permissions   | Adding a Owner or Run-Only User(s)       |
| Deleted permissions  | Removing an Owner or Run-Only User(s)    |
| Started a paid trial | Power Automate user started a paid trial |
| Renewed a paid trial | Power Automate renewed a paid trial      |

##### Life Cycle Events

Life cycle events include when a maker **creates**, **edits** and **deletes** a **Power Automate Flow**. These events include the exact time that a user created or modified a flow.

##### Edited / Deleted Flow Permission Event

The **Edited Flow Permission event** can show administrators which flows are actively shared between users and groups. Flow permissions can be set to **Owners** or **Run-Only Users**. The image below shows a sample of setting the run-only permission, highlighting the connections users and the scopes available.

## Next Steps

In this article we have covered getting started with the **Power Automate Management and Admin Connectors**. Each offers unique actions to help administrators report and taken action on environment flow. Continue exploring the capabilities of these connectors and actions through usage within **Power Automate Flows** or **Canvas Apps**. 

We have also covered the what activities are currently captured for **Power Automate**. Discussed in [**Part 2**](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---auditing-and-activity-logs-part-2) are techniques to view the audit logs within the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Portal** as well as **automated techniques**. 

This article is designed to supplement the article on **Power Automate Analytics**, which provides more of an all up view of **Power Automate** usage. Combining these two documents, an administrator can now <u>track analytic metrics as well as the events that define those metrics</u>.
