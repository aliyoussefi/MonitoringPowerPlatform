# Monitoring the Power Platform: Canvas Driven Apps - Auditing and Activity Logs Part 1

## Summary

**Microsoft Power Apps Canvas Apps** provide users the ability to quickly create and publish applications to their enterprise. With this ability comes concerns with governance to ensure users are allowed the appropriate permissions as well as identifying and highlighting specific apps across the organization. This article will explore **promoting a Canvas App as a Featured or Hero app** which can be used as communication devices during crisis, internal training, etc. From there the article will discuss other scenarios useful for monitoring **Canvas Apps** with the **Power Apps Administration PowerShell** cmdlets. To wrap up, the article will go into **activity events ** taken within the **Power Platform**. 

## Featured and Hero Apps

Once your enterprise begins creating **Power Apps**, one thing users will begin to notice is abundance of apps in your **Power Apps** environment. The **Power Apps Player** has functionality to allow users to search for a specific app but knowing what to look for and who published it can be a challenge. <u>By default **Power Apps** provides views which can help distinguish apps created or favorites by a user.</u>

For an enterprise, the ability to quickly create and promote an app is key driver for choosing **Power Apps** as a platform. *In a real world example, consider the COVID-19 crisis*. An enterprise may want to push out an app that **allows users to check in**, **provide emergency contacts**, or **stay up to date on the latest news**. An example of such as app is the [Crisis Communication Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/sample-crisis-communication-app), developed by Microsoft. Luckily Power Apps provides a mechanism to set an app to be a featured app which will prominently display in a specific view allowing users to quickly find and open the app.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/UnifiedAuditLog/CanvasApps/PowerApps.FeaturedAppAndHeroApp.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

As shown above, multiple featured apps can be added to a list available to all **Power Apps** users within the organization. 

A **Hero App**, is an app that will be shown at the top of default list for **Power Apps**. This is also extended to other lists, even the Featured List. The **Hero App** will also be given the headline "**FEATURED APP**" to help distinguish it from other apps. [As described in Pat Dunn's article, Discoverability in the Enterprise](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-discoverability-in-the-enterprise/), there can be only one **Hero App** for an organization. Also detailed in the article are the **PowerShell** cmdlets needed to create **Featured and Hero Apps**.

### Using PowerShell to create Featured and Hero Apps

To set an app as a **Featured** or **Hero** app, two **PowerShell** cmdlets are required. Before using the cmdlets, the specific modules that contain them need to be downloaded for use. The article, [PowerShell support for Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell), has step by step instructions of how to get and work with the modules. 

#### Install the Modules

To download the modules as an administrator, use the following command in **PowerShell**:

```
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell 
```

If you don't have admin rights, use the following **PowerShell** command:

```
Save-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell -Path 
Import-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
```

Be mindful of the -Path argument if working with automation such as **Azure DevOps Pipelines**.

#### Connect to Power Apps

To connect to your **Power Apps** tenant, run the following command in **PowerShell**:

```
Add-PowerAppsAccount
```

That command will prompt you for credentials. Using the *-Username* and *-Password* arguments, a s**cript can run a passive authentication without user input**.

#### Get Environment and Canvas App Identifiers

Once connected, you'll need the **Canvas App** identifier to set as the **Featured or Hero App**. A quick way for a **Power App** Maker or Admin to find the values needed are to navigate to the app itself and get the identifiers from the URL. The below URL is from my app I want to set as a Featured App:

https://make.powerapps.com/environments/{Environment ID}/apps/{Canvas App ID}/

This approach works well today if the URL continues to show the **Canvas App** Identifier. Another approach is to use **PowerShell** to get the App Id. The Environment Id can be found using the **Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment** cmdlet (*EnvironmentName*) while the App id can be found in the **Get-AdminPowerApp** cmdlet (*AppName*). Combining those values we can now use the Featured and Hero commands in PowerShell.

#### Set Canvas App as Featured or Hero App

**To mark an app as a Featured App** use the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```
Set-AdminPowerAppAsFeatured -AppName {AppName}
```

**To mark an app as a Hero App** use the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```
Set-AdminPowerAppAsHero -AppName {AppName}
```

When the commands are run, a response is sent back with a success HTTP code and headers including a request identifier. To confirm the **Power App is Featured or Hero**, a user can navigate to the **Power Apps Player** to view. As an administrator, I'll want tighter control and visibility into these actions as well as other lifecycle events for **Power Apps**. Capturing when apps are created and destroyed, updated and restored are integral to better understanding usage patterns and ensuring governance is applied. To find out more, refer to [**Part 2**](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-canvas-apps---auditing-and-activity-logs-part-2) where we will begin to search the **Unified Audit Log** for activity and audit logs.

### Other Useful Power Apps Administration PowerShell Tasks

The **PowerShell module for Power Apps Administration tasks** is an extremely useful way to view and take action on environments, apps, flows, connectors and permissions. The **PowerShell Support for Power Apps** page [contains a list of common operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#environments-commands) an administrator would find useful for governing an organization's use of the **Power Platform** and its environments. Some commands I'd like to call out are:

| Command                          | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Get-AdminDlpPolicy               | Displays all of the Data Loss Prevention Policies            |
| Remove-AllowedConsentPlans       | Can be used to remove the ability for uses to create trial licenses.<br />NOTE: It is important to note that when using *Remove-AllowedConsentPlans* all existing plans of the specified type will be removed from all users in the tenant and will not be recoverable. |
| Set-AdminPowerAppOwner           | Changes the owner of a Power App. This is useful for reassigning if someone leave the organization. |
| Set-AdminFlowOwnerRole           | Changes the owner of a Power Automate Flow. Again, useful for reassignment. |
| Recover-AdminPowerAppEnvironment | Recover a Power App Environment                              |

The "**Get**" cmdlets can all be used for **reporting and logging of the current state of an environment**. The below command from the examples on the **Power Apps PowerShell** page shows how to use the **OutputFilePath** argument to **write to a text file**.

```
Get-AdminPowerAppsUserDetails -OutputFilePath '.\adminUserDetails.txt' â€“UserPrincipalName 'admin@bappartners.onmicrosoft.com'
```

Consider the use of these commands with techniques discussed in *[Part 2 of Canvas Apps - Auditing and Activity Logs](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-canvas-apps---auditing-and-activity-logs-part-2)* for additional logging capabilities.

## Activity Events for Canvas Apps

### What events are audited?

The events audited by the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Center** allow for administrators to search across multiple services offered including **Power Apps**. These **logs are collected at the SDK layer**, meaning one action can actually trigger multiple event logs in the log store. Events collected include app lifecycle actions such as when an app is **created**, **edited** or **deleted**. User actions include **launching** an app or **modifying permissions**.

#### Common Audit Properties

Each audit record includes common properties that can be used to help search or even correlate events together. Fields such as **precise time stamps**, the **specific Canvas App**, the **operation performed** and **Identity of the record**. 

| Field name      | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date            | Date and time of when the log was generated in UTC           |
| App Name        | Unique Identifier of the PowerApp                            |
| Id              | Unique GUID for every row logged                             |
| Result Status   | Status of the row logged. Success in most cases.             |
| Organization Id | Unique identifier of the organization from which the log was generated. |
| CreationTime    | Date and time of when the log was generated in UTC           |
| Operation       | Name of operation                                            |
| UserKey         | Unique Identifier of the User in Azure AD                    |
| UserType        | The audit type (Admin, Regular, System)                      |
| Additional Info | Additional information if any (e.g. the environment name)    |

The **Identity** value is key as it can help us better understand a chain of events. Consider when promoting an app as a **Featured** App. **Marking an app as featured creates three events**:

*MarkPowerAppAsFeatured*

*PublishPowerApp*

*UpdatePowerApp*

The same goes with **promoting a Hero app** as well as other events such as **restoring a Canvas App** from a previous version.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/UnifiedAuditLog/CanvasApps/CanvasApp.Restore.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

**[In Part 2](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-canvas-apps---auditing-and-activity-logs-part-2)**, we will cover these events in detail to show how they are connected to paint a broader picture.

#### List of Events

The table below shows the events captured for **Power Apps** including **life cycle events of app**, **user modifications** and when a user launched a specific **Canvas App**. For an up to date reference check out the [Activity logging for Power Apps Audit Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/logging-powerapps) document.

| Event                  | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Created app            | When the app gets created for the first time by a maker      |
| Launched app           | When the app gets launched                                   |
| Marked app as Featured | Every time the app is marked as Featured                     |
| Restored app version   | The version of the app when restored                         |
| Edited app             | Any updates made to the app by the maker                     |
| Published app          | When the app is published and is now made available to others in the environment |
| Edited app permission  | Every time a user's permissions to the app is changed        |
| Deleted app            | When the app is deleted                                      |
| Marked app as Hero     | Every time the app is marked as Hero                         |
| Deleted app permission | Every time a user's permissions to the app is removed        |

##### Life Cycle Events

Life cycle events include when a maker **creates** an app, **edits** and **publishes** an app. Other events include **restoring** an app to a prior version as well as the previously mentioned **promoting** to a featured or hero app.

##### Launched Event

The **Launched** event is a highly asked for event that captured the precise time that a user logins into an app. This audited event allows admins to see the **user's Azure identifier** and **which app they logged into**. Not shown is the **user's session identifier** but this can be found **within the specific Canvas App run** which will be discussed later.

##### Edited App Permission Event

The **Edited App Permission event** is of interest as it shows **when and who shared an app**. The permission level (***CanEdit*** or ***CanView***) given, the **owner who shared** and **when they shared the app** is audited. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/UnifiedAuditLog/CanvasApps/ShareAnApp.gif" style="zoom:67%;" />

Resources can be shared and specifically for the **Common Data Service** connector, [security roles can be assigned for use with the connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/share-app-resources), which **will also assign the security role to the user within the environment**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/UnifiedAuditLog/CanvasApps/CustomSysAdminRoleInPowerApps.JPG" style="zoom:67%;" />

In the image above, I gave the user the "*Custom Sys Admins*" security role for the **Common Data Service connector**. Navigating to the user roles within the **Model Driven App** I can see the user now <u>has the same security role</u>. Consider the implications before adding a security role to a **Canvas App** user. For further reference, check out the [**Security Model for Common Data Service**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/security-model).
