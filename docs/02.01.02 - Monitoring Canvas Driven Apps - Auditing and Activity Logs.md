# Monitoring the Power Platform: Canvas Driven Apps - Auditing and Activity Logs

## Summary

**Microsoft Power Apps Canvas Apps** provide users the ability to quickly create and publish applications to their enterprise. With this ability comes concerns with governance to ensure users are allowed the appropriate permissions as well as identifying and highlighting specific apps across the organization. This article will explore **promoting a Canvas App as a featured or hero app** which can be used as communication devices during crisis, internal training, etc. From there the article will go into **activity and auditing to help administrators view specific actions** taken within the **Power Platform**. 

## Featured and Hero Apps

Once your enterprise begins creating **Power Apps**, one thing users will begin to notice is abundance of apps in your **Power Apps** environment. The **Power Apps Player** has functionality to allow users to search for a specific app but knowing what to look for and who published it can be a challenge. <u>By default **Power Apps** provides views which can help distinguish apps created or favorites by a user.</u>

For an enterprise, the ability to quickly create and promote an app is key driver for choosing **Power Apps** as a platform. *In a real world example, consider the COVID-19 crisis*. An enterprise may want to push out an app that **allows users to check in**, **provide emergency contacts**, or **stay up to date on the latest news**. An example of such as app is the [Crisis Communication Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/sample-crisis-communication-app), developed by Microsoft. Luckily Power Apps provides a mechanism to set an app to be a featured app which will prominently display in a specific view allowing users to quickly find and open the app.

As shown above, multiple featured apps can be added to a list available to all **Power Apps** users within the organization. 

A **Hero App**, is an app that will be shown at the top of default list for **Power Apps**. This is also extended to other lists, even the Featured List. The **Hero App** will also be given the headline "**FEATURED APP**" to help distinguish it from other apps. [As described in Pat Dunn's article, Discoverability in the Enterprise](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-discoverability-in-the-enterprise/), there can be only one **Hero App** for an organization. Also detailed in the article are the **PowerShell** cmdlets needed to create **Featured and Hero Apps**.

### Using PowerShell to create Featured and Hero Apps

To set an app as a Featured or Hero app, two PowerShell cmdlets are required. Before using the cmdlets, the specific modules that contain them need to be downloaded for use. The article, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell , has step by step instructions of how to get and work with the modules. 

#### Install the Modules

To download the modules as an administrator, use the following command in PowerShell:

```
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell 
```

If you don't have admin rights, use the following PowerShell command:

```
Save-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell -Path 
Import-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
```

Be mindful of the -Path argument if working with automation such as **Azure DevOps Pipelines**.

#### Connect to Power Apps

To connect to your **Power Apps** tenant, run the following command in PowerShell:

```
Add-PowerAppsAccount
```

That command will prompt you for credentials. Using the *-Username* and *-Password* arguments, a script can run a passive authentication without user input.

#### Get Environment and Canvas App Identifiers

Once connected, you'll need the **Canvas App** identifier to set as the **Featured or Hero App**. A quick way for a Power App Maker or Admin to find the values needed are to navigate to the app itself and get the identifiers from the URL. The below URL is from my app I want to set as a Featured App:

https://make.powerapps.com/environments/{Environment ID}/apps/{Canvas App ID}/

This approach works well today if the URL continues to show the **Canvas App** Identifier. Another approach is to use PowerShell to get the App Id. The Environment Id can be found using the **Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment** cmdlet (*EnvironmentName*) while the App id can be found in the **Get-AdminPowerApp** cmdlet (*AppName*). Combining those values we can now use the Featured and Hero commands in PowerShell.

#### Set Canvas App as Featured or Hero App

**To mark an app as a Featured App** use the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```
Set-AdminPowerAppAsFeatured -AppName {AppName}
```

**To mark an app as a Hero App** use the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```
Set-AdminPowerAppAsHero -AppName {AppName}
```

When the commands are run, a response is sent back with a success HTTP code and headers including a request identifier. To confirm the Power App is Featured or Hero, a user can navigate to the Power Apps Player to view. As an administrator, I'll want tighter control and visibility into these actions as well as other lifecycle events for Power Apps. Capturing when apps are created and destroyed, updated and restored are integral to better understanding usage patterns and ensuring governance is applied. To find out more, we will begin to search the Unified Audit Log for activity and audit logs.

## Activity Events for Canvas Apps

### What events are audited?

The events audited by the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Center** allow for administrators to search across multiple services offered including Power Apps. These logs are collected at the SDK layer meaning one action can actually trigger multiple event logs in the log store. Events collected include app lifecycle actions such as when an app is created, edited or deleted. User actions include launching an app or modifying permissions.

#### Common Audit Properties

Each audit record includes common properties that can be used to help search or even correlate events together. Fields such as precise time stamps, the specific Canvas App, the operation performed and Identity of the record. 

| Field name      | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date            | Date and time of when the log was generated in UTC           |
| App Name        | Unique Identifier of the PowerApp                            |
| Id              | Unique GUID for every row logged                             |
| Result Status   | Status of the row logged. Success in most cases.             |
| Organization Id | Unique identifier of the organization from which the log was generated. |
| CreationTime    | Date and time of when the log was generated in UTC           |
| Operation       | Name of operation                                            |
| UserKey         | Unique Identifier of the User in Azure AD                    |
| UserType        | The audit type (Admin, Regular, System)                      |
| Additional Info | Additional information if any (e.g. the environment name)    |

The **Identity** value is key as it can help us better understand a chain of events. Consider when promoting an app as a Featured App. **Marking an app as featured creates three events**:

*MarkPowerAppAsFeatured*

*PublishPowerApp*

*UpdatePowerApp*

The same goes with **promoting a Hero app** as well as other events such as **restoring a Canvas App** from a previous version.

#### List of Events

[Activity logging for Power Apps Audit Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/logging-powerapps)

| Event                  | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Created app            | When the app gets created for the first time by a maker      |
| Launched app           | When the app gets launched                                   |
| Marked app as Featured | Every time the app is marked as Featured                     |
| Restored app version   | The version of the app when restored                         |
| Edited app             | Any updates made to the app by the maker                     |
| Published app          | When the app is published and is now made available to others in the environment |
| Edited app permission  | Every time a user's permissions to the app is changed        |
| Deleted app            | When the app is deleted                                      |
| Marked app as Hero     | Every time the app is marked as Hero                         |
| Deleted app permission | Every time a user's permissions to the app is removed        |

##### Designer Events



##### Launched Event

The Launched event is a highly asked for event that captured the precise time that a user logins into an app.

##### Edited App Permission Event

The Edited App Permission event is of interest as it shows when and who shared an app. The permission level (*CanEdit* or *CanView*), the owner who shared and when they shared the app is audited. Resources can be shared and specifically for the Common Data Service connector, [security roles can be assigned for use with the connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/share-app-resources), which **will also assign the security role to the user within the environment**.

## Searching the Unified Audit Log

Searching the Unified Audit Log can be performed manually but the log can also be search with automation. Manually there is a portal called the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center Portal that provides a centralized area for auditing all Office 365 services including the Power Platform. If automation is desired the Unified Audit Log offers both a PowerShell module and an API which can be subscribed to. This section covers all three of these in detail. 

#### The Office 365 Security and Compliance Center Portal

The Office 365 Security and Compliance Center found at https://protection.office.com can be used by security analysts to manually search for specific events using a portal user interface. 

<u>NOTE: Be mindful of the [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center?view=o365-worldwide) and licenses needed to use this feature.</u>

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/media/audit-log-search-pa.png)

As shown in the image above, a single action or multiple activities for Canvas App can be chosen for analysis. To begin our search, [run an audit log search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide#search-the-audit-log) by specifying the activities, the time range and optional search parameters such as users or site. Once the search is complete, [review the results](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide#step-2-view-the-search-results) in the portal. The results are maxed out at the most 5000 newest events and are incremented 150 records at a time. 

#### PowerShell

For PowerShell the ***Search-UnifiedAuditLog***, part of the **MSOline** module, is used for **Office 365** services including **Power Apps Canvas and Model Driven Apps**. For **Canvas Apps** there exist a record type called "**PowerAppsApp**" that will scope to only logs from **Canvas Apps**. Using the same table above, here are the PowerShell Operation equivalents to each captured event:

| Event                  | PowerShell Operation      |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Created app            | CreatePowerApp            |
| Launched app           | LaunchPowerApp            |
| Marked app as Featured | MarkPowerAppAsFeatured    |
| Restored app version   | PromotePowerAppVersion    |
| Edited app             | UpdatePowerApp            |
| Published app          | PublishPowerApp           |
| Edited app permission  | PowerAppPermissionEdited  |
| Deleted app            | DeletePowerApp            |
| Marked app as Hero     | MarkPowerAppAsHero        |
| Deleted app permission | PowerAppPermissionDeleted |

```
$endDate = Get-Date
$startDate = $endDate.AddDays(-7) #Search last 7 days
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -RecordType PowerAppsApp
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/CanvasApps/UnifiedAuditLog-Examples.JPG)

Depending on what type of audit record you're looking for, the search can be filtered using the Operation argument.

Example of searching for Canvas App creation events:

```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -RecordType PowerAppsApp -Operation "CreatePowerApp"
```

Example of searching for Canvas App launch events:

```
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -RecordType PowerAppsApp -Operation "LaunchPowerApp"
```

Each record returned includes the data of the audit, the user and the data collected within the ***AuditData*** property. The **app and environment properties** are available within this property which can be **extracted and stored for contextual information to a log data store**.

### Office 365 Management Activity API

Another way to automate delivery of audit data is by use of the **Office 365 Management Activity API**. A really great article by ... covers how to setup a subscription and webhook to deliver to Cosmos DB. 

## Advanced Audit in Microsoft 365

A recent addition to the compliance tooling within Office 365 is the Advanced Audit feature. Currently I do not see anything specific to the Power Platform but this may change in the future. The key call out I see from the documentation is the ability to retain audit logs from one year and the high bandwidth accessibility for the **Office 365 Management Activity API**.

## Next Steps

In this article we have covered getting started with the **Power App Administration PowerShell** module and cmdlets for **Featured and Hero App promotion**. Continue exploring the capabilities of this module as it pertains to your **Power Apps Canvas App** administrative operations. 

We have also covered the **Unified Audit Logs** and what activities are currently captured for **Power Apps Canvas Apps**. Discussed were techniques to view the audit logs within the **Office 365 Security and Compliance Portal** as well as automated techniques using subscriptions and webhooks as well as **automating PowerShell using Azure Automation**. <u>Consider the combination of using the **Unified Audit Log** to notify of events happening and the **Power App Administration** cmdlets to apply security and enrich audits from the audit log.</u>

This article is designed to supplement the article on **Power App Analytics**, which provides more of an all up view of Canvas App usage. Combining these two documents, an administrator can now <u>track analytic metrics as well as the events that define those metrics</u>.
