# Monitoring the Power Platform: Power Automate - Connectors, Connections and Data Loss Prevention Policies

## Summary

**Connectors** are used throughout **Power Platform Pillars** such as **Microsoft Power Automate** and **Microsoft Power Apps**. They are also used in **Azure** services such as **Azure Logic Apps**. **Connectors** are a wrapper around first and third party APIs to provide a way for services to talk to each other. They represent the glue between services, allowing users to setup **Connections** to connect various accounts together. These connectors encompass a wide range of SaaS providers including **Dynamics 365**, **Office 365**, **Dropbox**, **Salesforce** and more.

This article will explore **Connectors** and **Connections** to help administrators better understand how they are being leveraged within the **Power Platform**. We will discuss components of connectors and where to go to find out about connectors used with **Power Apps** and **Power Automate**. Next, we will connections and their boundaries and impact. Finally, we will explore **Data Loss Prevention Policies** and how to restrict connector usage for business and non-business related purposes.

## Connector Components

Each **connector** used in the **Power Platform** consists of operations called "**Actions**" and "**Triggers**". 

### Actions

Actions are operations that read, change or manipulate data or variables, all directed by a Maker. These are tied to the **Connector (Open API) definition** provided by each service. Examples include Reading data from the **Common Data Service**, sending emails through **Outlook** or internal operations such as parsing JSON or looping through a result set.

### Triggers

Triggers represent notifications to **Microsoft Power Automate Flows** or **Azure Logic Apps** that an event has occurred. They are generally grouped into two types of triggers: **Poll and Push Triggers**.

A **polling trigger** makes a call into the API at a reoccurring frequency to check for new messages. When new data is available, the trigger will run the **Flow** or **Logic App**. Examples include **timer triggers**. A great breakdown into explaining, using and creating a custom connector that uses polling is titled "[**Use a polling trigger for Azure Logic Apps and Microsoft Power Automate**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/create-polling-trigger#create-polling-triggers-from-the-ui)".

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Triggers/how-polling-works.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

A **push trigger** is a listener waiting for an event to occur or a message to be received. Once received, the trigger will run the **Flow** or **Logic App.** Examples include **Flow button presses**, **HTTP or Webhook** connectors. Another article, titled "**[Use a webhook as a trigger for Azure Logic Apps and Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/create-webhook-trigger)**", explains how to create a custom connector for GitHub to listen for push events on a repo.

## Connector Definition

In the case of the [**Dropbox** connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/dropbox/#definitions), we can see in the documentation the actions and triggers defined in the Open API definition. This same definition is available using the **PowerApps Administration PowerShell module** or **Management connector** and the *list connectors* action. The image below was extracted from the Management connector list connector action.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Connector.Dropbox.NameAndProprties.JPG" style="zoom: 80%;" />

Each connector definition will include a "tier" property, this tells administrators if the connector is considered premium. This can also impact out **DLP Policies** discussed below.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Connector.Dropbox.DescriptionAndTier.JPG"  />

### Standard and Premium Connector Tiers

[Both Standard and Premium tiers are available based on the type of Office 365 licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq). Below you'll find references to both tiers. Standard licenses, where the service is owned by Microsoft, [can't be added to the **Blocked Data Loss Prevention Policy**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention) discussed below.

[List of Standard Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-standard-connectors)

### Preview and Production Connector Release Statuses

**Preview** Connectors, can be used in Production environments but with caution as indicated by the light blub symbol attached to each connector. If a connector is not in preview, then its considered in a **Production** release status. For each connector, check to see the regional availability using the links provided.

[List of Preview Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-preview-connectors)

[List of Production Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-production-connectors)

## Custom Connectors

As described above, hundreds (as of this time 325+) of connectors exist to allow **Power Apps** and **Power Automate** to talk to services. That said, there will eventually come a time where an API that your app or flow needs to talk to will not be available as a provided connector. Luckily, the concept of [**Custom Connectors**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/) can help fill this gap. 

**Custom connectors** allow developers to build and secure APIs that can be consumed by Makers and Users of the **Power Platform**. Common examples include using **Azure Functions** or **Web Apps** to **build** an API and using **Azure AD** to **secure** the API. Finally, the API will need to be **defined** and **described** using a specification called **Open API**. One of the advantages of using **Azure Functions is that it can generate the Open API spec** for a developer, allowing for a seamless handoff to the author of the **Custom Connector**.

This image from the **Custom Connectors** overview does a wonderful job of visualizing the steps involved here.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Custom/authoring-steps.png"  />

The scope of creating a **custom connector** covers a wide range of additional concepts and considerations, such as authentication and access protocols. I would consider starting with [this step by step to begin creating your own Custom Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/create-postman-collection) or here for using the [Logic Apps Custom Connector service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/create-logic-apps-connector) in **Microsoft Azure**. **Custom connectors** are scoped to a specific environment, this is important when discussing **Data Loss Prevention Policies** below.

## Solution Aware Connectors

[Custom connectors can also be created within Dynamics 365 or Common Data Service solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/use-solution-explorer). Enterprises that need to utilize custom connectors in a production ready environment, will want **automation tools to migrate changes from developers**. [Solution aware custom connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/customconnectorssolutions), as part of a **Common Data Service** solution, can be neatly packaged and moved across sandbox and test environments towards production. Administrators can leverage existing tools such as [**Solution Packager**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/compress-extract-solution-file-solutionpackager) to unpack and store within source control.

When working with custom connectors in solutions, be sure to reference and evaluate the [Known Limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/customconnectorssolutions#known-limitations) currently with this feature.

## Connections

**Connections** are used by **Power Apps** and **Power Automate** to activate and work with **Connectors**. When viewing within the Portal, each connection has an identifier, the connector its using, the creation time and who created it as well as the current environment and status. Each connection shows how its used across **Power Apps** and **Power Automate Flows**. The below image shows a connection in the **Maker Portal**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Connections.AppInsights.Portal.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Here is the same *Azure Application Insights* connection shown using the **PowerShell module for Power Apps Administration tasks**. This option provides us an option to view the current status programmatically.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Connections.AppInsights.PowerShell.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

The **same connector can be used for multiple connections** as shown in the image below with multiple entries for *Azure DevOps*.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Connections.Overview.MultipleSameConnector.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Connections** can be connected to a user account but can also work with service principals. [The supported types of authentication are None, Basic, API Key and OAuth 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/connection-parameters).

### Connections across environments

Environments represent boundaries between data sources, customizations, etc within the **Power Platform** and this includes connections. One question that will eventually come up is how to work with solution aware components that use connections. The connections that may be used for development purposes won't necessarily work in production workloads.

The typical approach I've seen is to create the connections manually and update the connector's connection where needed. Using **PowerShell** or potentially other connectors (i.e. **Power Automate Management**), automation techniques can be applied as part of your ALM strategy.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Moving Solutions and Configuring Connections.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Quick Point on Migrating Managed Solution Power Automate Flows

Recently I begin investigating scenarios of moving flows and applying connections as referenced above. Using that approach I was able to apply connections using automation techniques with **Microsoft Power Automate**. This worked and I was able to successfully apply the connection and [turn on the Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/web-api#update-a-flow) using the [**Power Automate (CDS) API**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/web-api). However by doing this, an **active unmanaged layer was introduced**. This causes concern as subsequent changes performed on the flow will be underneath the active layer as pointed out in [this **Known Limitations** section](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/use-solution-explorer#known-limitations).  

"*Importing a solution containing a flow will not automatically create or associate required connections. The flow must be edited to fix the connections.*

- *If using managed solutions, this creates an active customization in the unmanaged layer. Therefore subsequent solution updates to the flow will not be reflected*."

Until I find a solution to this, consider removing the active layer and applying the solution. In my findings when the active layer was applied, the flow reverted back to its original state. [Here is the extracted flow to use as an example](https://github.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/raw/master/Samples/PowerAutomate/SolutionAware/TurnonImportedFlowfromSolution_20200430181254.zip).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/Flow.TurnOnSolutionAwareFlow.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Data Loss Prevention Policies

[**Data Loss Prevention Policies**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention) help protect and secure organizational data within an enterprise by providing rules enforcing what connectors can be used. **Connectors** can be grouped into **Business**, **Non-Business** and **Blocked** classifications which determine if they can be used within **Power Apps** or **Flows**. These **policies can be scoped to a specific environment or across all environments** within a tenant.

Here is an image showing a **Business Data Only** policy I created that is **scoped to a single environment**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors//DLP/BusinessDataOnly.Example.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Blocked policies** restrict resources from interacting with a specific service. All third-party connections and Microsoft owned **Premium** connectors (except **Common Data Service**) can be blocked.

This image shows an error message when attempting to use connectors that are from different policy groups.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/DLP/Flow.DlpViolation.ErrorMessage.JPG"  />

### DLP Policies and Power App Administration PowerShell

As detailed in "[Introducing HTTP and Custom Connector Support for Data Loss Prevention Policies](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-http-and-custom-connector-support-for-data-loss-prevention-policies/)" by [Jonathon Levesque](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/author/jolevesq/), these policies can be used for **HTTP and Custom Connectors**. There is an important note that Jonathon documents that is worth pointing out:

"*To add support for custom connectors and/or HTTP connectors to a policy using the PowerShell, download and import the latest PowerApps PowerShell scripts from the link above and use the cmdlets ‘New-AdminDlpPolicy’, ‘Set-AdminDlpPolicy’, ‘Add-CustomConnectorToPolicy’, and ‘Remove-CustomConnectorFromPolicy’ to modify a policy. The cmdlet ‘Get-Help <cmdlet name> -detailed’ can be used as a reference.*

*Note: Use the schema version ‘2018-11-01′ when creating or updating a DLP policy to include HTTP connectors. Adding HTTP support using the template or PowerShell will only affect the specified policy. New policies created via the Admin Center will not contain the HTTP connectors.*

*Caution: WE DO NOT SUPPORT DOWNGRADING FROM SCHEMA VERSION 2018-11-01. Once HTTP support is added to a policy, it cannot be taken away. Attempting to do so may corrupt that DLP policy. Furthermore, if a DLP policy is updated to support HTTP connectors, current flows using these HTTP capabilities may be shut off.*"

This image shows, using the **Power App Administration PowerShell** module and the **Get-AdminDlpPolicy** cmdlet, I can list out the connectors for both business and non-business groups.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/DLP/BusinessDataOnly.PowerShell.Example.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Using the below **PowerShell** command, the **DLP Policy** can be read and audited.

```
Get-AdminDlpPolicy {DLP Policy Name}
```

The **PowerShell** command above shows how to work with the **DLP Policy Name** to limit the response to a specific policy. The name can easily be found in the **URL** within the **PowerApps Admin Portal**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/Connectors/DLP/DlpPolicyNamefromUrlToPowerShell.JPG" style="zoom: 80%;" />

Here is a gif showing the login flow and using the **Get-AdminDlpPolicy** and reviewing the **Non-Business Data Group**.

## Next Steps

In this article we have covered foundational information and concepts for **Connectors**, **Connections** and **Data Loss Prevention Policies**. We have discussed some of the boundaries and limitations to be aware of. Examples of working with the **Power Apps Admin Portal** as well as the **PowerApps Administration PowerShell modules** were examined.

This article is a good starting point to better understanding how to work with powerful connectors such as the **Power Automate Management and Admin connectors** referenced in a future article. The article also begins the journey into the **Power Automate API** and how **solution layers can impact changes to components**.
