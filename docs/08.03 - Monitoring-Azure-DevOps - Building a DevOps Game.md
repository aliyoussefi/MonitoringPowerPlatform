# Monitoring the Power Platform: Azure DevOps - The Azure DevOps Connector and Canvas Driven Apps

## Summary

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/) has become more and more ingrained into our **Power Platform** project lifecycle. Work item tracking and feedback tools for teamwork. Continuous integration and delivery for code changes and solution deployments. Automated testing for assurance, compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/#culture)** provides native capabilities to plan, work, collaborate and deliver. Each step along the way in our [**Power Platform DevOps** journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools) can be tracked and monitored which will be the primary objective of this article.

This article will focus on feedback, specifically from events that happen with **Azure DevOps**. We will first look at subscription setup and notifications to team members and interested parties. From there we will dive deeper into feedback events, how they work, how they can be filtered and delivered. Finally we will review a real world example utilizing service hooks, **Power Automate** and **Microsoft Teams**.

## Sources

Sources of Azure DevOps events that impact our delivery can come from virtually any area of the platform including work items, pipelines, source control, testing and artifact delivery. For each one of these events, such as completed work items, we can setup visualizations such as charts based on defined queries. Service hooks and notification subscriptions can be configured to allow real time reporting of events to external parties and systems allowing for us to stay in a state of continuous communication and collaboration.

## Pipelines
### Build Pipelines

Build Pipeline has capabilities to review analytics from an API. This allows us to request for each build not only the logs and timings but how the build compares to previous builds. From this we can conclude if our builds are trending in the right direction and if not, what can we do to course correct.

Below is a list of the Azure DevOps REST API operations I find useful:

| API Definition                                               | Comments                                                     |

### Builds

Build Pipeline executions are represented using the Builds REST API. Within each build, we can find answers such as what the build number is, did it pass or fail, what code changes it contains and who requested it.

## Azure DevOps Connector

[The **Azure DevOps connector**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#actions), available for both **Power Automate** and **Azure Logic Apps**, contain specific actions and triggers that allow Makers to work with the **Azure DevOps REST API**. 

### Actions and Triggers

The **Azure DevOps connector** contains both Triggers and Actions. [Triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#triggers) can be thought of as service hooks, described in the article "", allowing for integrations and interested parties to register on notable events such as [work item changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#when-a-work-item-is-updated). Actions allow Makers the ability to send messages back and forth to Azure DevOps. Scenarios might include creating and querying work items, which would be helpful for tracking active work for each sprint or even creating an Issue on error of a Power Automate Flow.

### Scenario: Automating Work Item Creation

In this scenario we have a Power Automate Flow that is failing due to an integration action. The Power Automate Flow, using the technique detailed in "[Power Automate - Run Time Part 2: Tracked Properties and Error Handling](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---run-time-part-2-tracked-properties-and-error-handling)" gracefully captures a scoped error. Once captured, the Power Automate Flow will process the exception and create a User Story work item.  

<insert try catch scope>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/ADO.Areas.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Using the results() function and error object we can pass as part of the description or acceptance criteria the error details. Additional details such as Area Path can help alert the Power Automate Support team that an investigation user story is available. The Link URL field could hold the run information from ProcessSimple, allowing the support team to navigate to the specific error.

<insert work item>

### Scenario: Enriching Work Items and Reports

This scenario came up during a recent status call I was on. During each call active work items are discussed in a consolidated list, typically Microsoft Excel. One challenge is that the query export feature within Azure DevOps doesn't include the ability to extract comments or discussion points. This requires the call lead to navigate back to Azure DevOps and open each item to review and/or update. Luckily, using both the Azure DevOps connector and the previously mentioned REST API, we can provide a solution.

<insett flow devops work item reports>

The Power Automate flow in this example, is triggered by a message to a Teams Channel. The message will kick off a Power Automate Flow that will run a previously defined query that can be passed in from the Teams message. The results from the query will be returned and will be iterated through. For each work item returned we can run an optional action called "Get work item details" to supplement each work item. I would suggest if possible to include the summarized data points in the query results to attempt to avoid this step if possible.

Now, to enrich each work item, we will make use of the Azure DevOps connector action "Send an HTTP request to Azure DevOps" to gather comments for each work item. I'll elaborate more on that connector action below.

<insert http request for comments>

Finally, we can generate our Microsoft Excel worksheet and use email, OneDrive, SharePoint, etc. to deliver and store our artifact.

## The Azure DevOps Connector Action and the REST API 

The Azure DevOps Connector action "Send an HTTP request to Azure DevOps" allows Makers an unbelievable amount of flexibility when working with Azure DevOps. Any action available for the REST API can be utilized by the connector. The action is so flexible that if one of the pre built actions, such as Queue a Build, doesn't provide conditions required, we can simply issue the same request using this action in its place.  This is really a testament to the design and interoperability that both of these services offer.

<insert generic http action>

I began working with this action when I wanted to explore other options outside of writing .NET or PowerShell. My goal was to build a fully functional DevOps Canvas App that would allow team members to interact with Azure DevOps without the need to login and watch timers and action icons progress. With that in mind, I'll detail my experience working with the Azure DevOps Connector and Microsoft Power Apps to build a custom front end solution.

## Building a Custom Azure DevOps User Experience

When I was younger I loved playing video games, especially role playing games or RPGs. Over this past winter break I took some time to try a new concept: How can I take something that may be considered somewhat dry by some, and turn it on its head and make it fun. With that in mind, I decided to create an interactive game, writing zero code, that could help include team members from all backgrounds.

### <insert home screen>

The Canvas App needed to be functional, infromative and fun. What could be more fun than using a popular video game from my past?

## Creating a Game using Canvas Apps and Power Automate

Working with Power Apps Canvas Apps, I was quickly able to design multiple screens to host my menu and my different pages that would interact with the Azure DevOps REST API.

<insert side bar navigation>

Each screen encompasses a new area for team members to explore and work or play. This includes reviewing previous builds (reviewing stats), queuing new builds (earning points) and monitoring progress. Along the way, if a user found a new way to optimize the process, they could gain multipliers and score more.

### Reviewing Previous Builds

The Build REST API allows Makers to queue new builds, check the status, review prior builds and analyze trends. Builds include their badges and who initated them.

<insert check build summaries>

Each Build includes additional information allowing for insights similar to a post battle screen.

<insert build final screen>

### Analyzing a Specific Build

Using the Azure DevOps Connector, a request can be made to get an individual build. 

<insert http action>

Using the REST API documentation, we can build the request with parameters. Having the ability to add additional query string parameters helps define what is returned which can help speed up the Power Automate Flow or reduce subsequent calls back to the service.

<inset game screen>

#### Timeline and Logs

The Build API request can be extended to show the timeline or logs. Natively neither is included in the build request most likely to keep the payload size manageable.

To request the timeline, useful for capturing statuses and timings of each build action, add the "/Timeline" query string to the Build request.

<insert timeline>

To gather logs for failed builds and their actions, simply swap out the "/Timeline" for "/Logs".

<insert logs flow>

Combining the data from the three requests we can build out the entire build, helping determine how many points the build earned.

```
ce-workshop/_apis/build/builds/<build ID>

ce-workshop/_apis/build/builds/<build ID>/Timeline

ce-workshop/_apis/build/builds/<build ID>/logs
```

<insert game screen with logs and timeline>

Remember, the Canvas App data table object relies on a flattened response, so be sure to work the response from the service to something more manageable.

<insert edit screen>

### Queueing a new Build

Each build within the game represents a new opportunity for users to gain points. Each successful action in the build gains points while each action that fails or doesn't run will take points away. If a build is completely successful a multiplier is added.

<Show a build>

When a build is kicked off, a Canvas App timer is kicked off that requests updates every few seconds. Each time an action is completed, one of the opponents is defeated, allowing for our hero to progress.
