# Monitoring the Power Platform: Azure DevOps - Scenarios Using the REST API and Connectors

## Summary

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/) has become more and more ingrained into our **Power Platform** project lifecycle. Work item tracking and feedback tools for teamwork. Continuous integration and delivery for code changes and solution deployments. Automated testing for assurance, compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/#culture)** provides native capabilities to plan, work, collaborate and deliver. Each step along the way in our [**Power Platform DevOps** journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools) can be tracked and monitored which will be the primary objective of this article.

This article will focus on feedback, specifically from events that happen with **Azure DevOps**. We will first look at subscription setup and notifications to team members and interested parties. From there we will dive deeper into feedback events, how they work, how they can be filtered and delivered. Finally we will review a real world example utilizing service hooks, **Power Automate** and **Microsoft Teams**.

## Sources

Sources of Azure DevOps events that impact our delivery can come from virtually any area of the platform including work items, pipelines, source control, testing and artifact delivery. For each one of these events, such as completed work items, we can setup visualizations such as charts based on defined queries. Service hooks and notification subscriptions can be configured to allow real time reporting of events to external parties and systems allowing for us to stay in a state of continuous communication and collaboration.

## Azure DevOps REST API

### Choosing between the SDK and invoking the endpoint directly

To connect to the Azure DevOps REST API an administrator can use [HTTP requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) directly or the [client library (SDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1#client-libraries). 

To work with the SDK you can leverage SOAP or REST requests, its recommended to use [the RESTful libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/dotnet-client-libraries?view=azure-devops). The SDK will help simplify your code and works across multiple frameworks include .NET, Node.js and Python. A [reference to the Azure DevOps Dot Net Sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-dotnet-samples) can be found on GitHub.

If you choose to not take on the dependency of the SDK the REST API can still be used and invoked. The decision here is how you plan to utilize your REST API solution and which solution fits best.

### Authenticating with a Personal Access Token or SSH

Personal Access Token are alternative passwords that allow DevOps administrators to issue temporary access to trusted applications that wish to work with the REST API. To setup a PAT, please review [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/_shared/_img/my-profile-team-services-preview.png?view=azure-devops)

For a detailed description of how to choose the right authentication mechanism, please go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/authentication-guidance?view=azure-devops). If you are working with a Linux container or environment continue using the SSH Keys.

### Components of a REST Request

#### The URL and API Versions

```
VERB https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis[/{area}]/{resource}?api-version={version}
```

You should leverage API Versioning when working with REST APIs to avoid breaking changes. Azure DevOps REST API offers backwards compatibility with this approach. Below are some of the versions you can use:

- `api-version=1.0`
- `api-version=1.2-preview`
- `api-version=2.0-preview.1`

API Versioning Reference is located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1#api-and-tfs-version-mapping).

#### Request Header and Body

A HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, etc) can be used and most of the time a bearer token will be needed as well that will be passed in with an Authorization header. Please reference the "*Authenticating with a Personal Access Token or SSH*" area to learn how to generate this token. MIME encoding maybe needed (i.e. application/json) and can be added with the content-type header.

#### Sample Request and Response

Below is an example using PowerShell to list projects in the *contoso* organization:

Request:

```
GET https://dev.azure.com/contoso/_apis/projects?api-version=5.0 HTTP/1.1
authorization: Basic ***sanitizied***
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) WindowsPowerShell/5.1.18362.145
Content-Type: application/json
Host: dev.azure.com

```

Response:

```
{
  "count": 1,
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "<project guid>",
      "name": "<project name>",
      "url": "https://dev.azure.com/contoso/_apis/projects/{project guid}",
      "state": "wellFormed",
      "revision": 19,
      "visibility": "public",
      "lastUpdateTime": "2019-11-04T15:38:16.723Z"
    }
  ]
}
```



### Common Operations

The Azure DevOps APIs and SDK provide the ability many different operations to retrieve information from project and user membership, work items, source control, automation, testing and governance. Common operations of interest for monitoring include identifying statuses and metrics of builds, capturing logs from pipelines and tasks and auditing of user membership and policies. 



When creating the subscription, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First only project administrators will have access to edit and view subscriptions by default. This can be adjusted to grant privileges  to other users. Also, specific actions may be limited depending on which event type is chosen.[Create a service hooks subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/create-subscription?view=azure-devops) programmatically.

#### DevOps Subscription REST API

Common operations performed with the REST API include configuring a subscription and getting list of publishers. The [Replace Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/hooks/subscriptions/replace%20subscription?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) is handy for updating the subscription for example of a WebHook service hook allowing to programmatically reconfigure the url to a local service for testing (e.g. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/product)).

#### DevOps REST API

The Azure DevOps REST API provides the ability to configure [notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/notification/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) and [subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/notification/subscriptions?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) and review [diagnostics logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/notification/diagnostic%20logs/list?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1). Diagnostic logs are useful to troubleshoot what notifications were sent and if there were issues with the delivery.

## Pipelines
### Build Pipelines

Build Pipeline has capabilities to review analytics from an API. This allows us to request for each build not only the logs and timings but how the build compares to previous builds. From this we can conclude if our builds are trending in the right direction and if not, what can we do to course correct.

Below is a list of the Azure DevOps REST API operations I find useful:

| API Definition                                               | Comments                                                     |

### Builds

Build Pipeline executions are represented using the Builds REST API. Within each build, we can find answers such as what the build number is, did it pass or fail, what code changes it contains and who requested it.

## Azure DevOps Connector

[The **Azure DevOps connector**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#actions), available for both **Power Automate** and **Azure Logic Apps**, contain specific actions and triggers that allow Makers to work with the **Azure DevOps REST API**. 

### Actions and Triggers

The **Azure DevOps connector** contains both Triggers and Actions. [Triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#triggers) can be thought of as service hooks, described in the article "", allowing for integrations and interested parties to register on notable events such as [work item changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#when-a-work-item-is-updated). Actions allow Makers the ability to send messages back and forth to Azure DevOps. Scenarios might include creating and querying work items, which would be helpful for tracking active work for each sprint or even creating an Issue on error of a Power Automate Flow.

### Scenario: Automating Work Item Creation

In this scenario we have a Power Automate Flow that is failing due to an integration action. The Power Automate Flow, using the technique detailed in "[Power Automate - Run Time Part 2: Tracked Properties and Error Handling](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/monitoring-the-power-platform-power-automate---run-time-part-2-tracked-properties-and-error-handling)" gracefully captures a scoped error. Once captured, the Power Automate Flow will process the exception and create a User Story work item.  

<insert try catch scope>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/ADO.Areas.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Using the results() function and error object we can pass as part of the description or acceptance criteria the error details. Additional details such as Area Path can help alert the Power Automate Support team that an investigation user story is available. The Link URL field could hold the run information from ProcessSimple, allowing the support team to navigate to the specific error.

<insert work item>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/ADO.Areas.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Scenario: Enriching Work Items and Reports

This scenario came up during a recent status call I was on. During each call active work items are discussed in a consolidated list, typically Microsoft Excel. One challenge is that the query export feature within Azure DevOps doesn't include the ability to extract comments or discussion points. This requires the call lead to navigate back to Azure DevOps and open each item to review and/or update. Luckily, using both the Azure DevOps connector and the previously mentioned REST API, we can provide a solution.

<insett flow devops work item reports>

The Power Automate flow in this example, is triggered by a message to a Teams Channel. The message will kick off a Power Automate Flow that will run a previously defined query that can be passed in from the Teams message. The results from the query will be returned and will be iterated through. For each work item returned we can run an optional action called "Get work item details" to supplement each work item. I would suggest if possible to include the summarized data points in the query results to attempt to avoid this step if possible.

Now, to enrich each work item, we will make use of the Azure DevOps connector action "Send an HTTP request to Azure DevOps" to gather comments for each work item. I'll elaborate more on that connector action below.

<insert http request for comments>

Finally, we can generate our Microsoft Excel worksheet and use email, OneDrive, SharePoint, etc. to deliver and store our artifact.

## The Azure DevOps Connector Action and the REST API 

The Azure DevOps Connector action "Send an HTTP request to Azure DevOps" allows Makers an unbelievable amount of flexibility when working with Azure DevOps. Any action available for the REST API can be utilized by the connector. The action is so flexible that if one of the pre built actions, such as Queue a Build, doesn't provide conditions required, we can simply issue the same request using this action in its place.  This is really a testament to the design and interoperability that both of these services offer.

<insert generic http action>

I began working with this action when I wanted to explore other options outside of writing .NET or PowerShell. My goal was to build a fully functional DevOps Canvas App that would allow team members to interact with Azure DevOps without the need to login and watch timers and action icons progress. With that in mind, I'll detail my experience working with the Azure DevOps Connector and Microsoft Power Apps to build a custom front end solution.

## Building a Custom Azure DevOps User Experience

When I was younger I loved playing video games, especially role playing games or RPGs. Over this past winter break I took some time to try a new concept: How can I take something that may be considered somewhat dry by some, and turn it on its head and make it fun. With that in mind, I decided to create an interactive game, writing zero code, that could help include team members from all backgrounds.

### <insert home screen>

The Canvas App needed to be functional, infromative and fun. What could be more fun than using a popular video game from my past?

## Creating a Game using Canvas Apps and Power Automate

Working with Power Apps Canvas Apps, I was quickly able to design multiple screens to host my menu and my different pages that would interact with the Azure DevOps REST API.

<insert side bar navigation>

Each screen encompasses a new area for team members to explore and work or play. This includes reviewing previous builds (reviewing stats), queuing new builds (earning points) and monitoring progress. Along the way, if a user found a new way to optimize the process, they could gain multipliers and score more.

### Reviewing Previous Builds

The Build REST API allows Makers to queue new builds, check the status, review prior builds and analyze trends. Builds include their badges and who initated them.

<insert check build summaries>

Each Build includes additional information allowing for insights similar to a post battle screen.

<insert build final screen>

### Queueing a new Build

Each build within the game represents a new opportinity for users to gain points. Each successful action in the build gains points while each action that fails or doesn't run will take points away. If a build is completely successful a multiplier is added.

<Show a build>

When a build is kicked off, a Canvas App timer is kicked off that requests updates every few seconds. Each time an action is completed, one of the opponents is defeated, allowing for our hero to progress.

<show downed mage>
