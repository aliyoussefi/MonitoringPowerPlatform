# Monitoring the Power Platform: Deployments

## Summary

DevOps has become more and more ingrained into our Power Platform planning and operations throughout the project lifecycle. From work item templates and feedback tools to continuous integration and delivery to automated testing to compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, Azure DevOps includes native capabilities to work with packaged changes and data that can be automated for delivery to production environments. Each step along the way can be tracked and monitored which will be the focus of this section.

## Sources

Sources of Azure DevOps events that impact our delivery can come from virtually any area of the platform including work items, pipelines, source control, testing and artifact delivery. For each one of these events, such as completed work items, we can setup visualizations such as charts based on defined queries. Service hooks and notification subscriptions can be configured to allow real time reporting of events to external parties and systems allowing for us to stay in a state of continuous communication and collaboration.

## Service Hooks and Notifications

### Service Hooks

[Service Hooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/overview?view=azure-devops#what-is-a-service-hook) are a great way of staying informed of events happening within Azure DevOps allowing you to be freed up to focus on other things. Examples include pushing notifications to your teams' mobile devices, notifying team members on Microsoft Teams or even invoking Microsoft Power Automate flows.

#### Using Web Hooks

Web Hooks allow for publishing messages and events to any type of service interested in the PowerApps DevOps process. Services can include other build and release platforms (i.e. Jenkins and Slack), Collaboration tools like Office 365, Customer Support interfaces like UserVoice and Integration services (Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage, Zapier, etc). Azure DevOps also provides the ability to integrate with a generic web hook that may not be available in the Visual Studio Marketplace. This is useful for custom connectors used in Microsoft Power Automate, Azure API Management, etc.

## Microsoft Teams, Continuous Collaboration and Integration

 has quickly grown into one of my favorite features. [Azure DevOps dashboards and kanban boards can be added to channels for visualizations of progress](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/integrations/boards-teams?view=azure-devops). 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/WorkItems-Dashboard-TeamsEmbedded.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Multiple Azure DevOps bots can be configured to deliver messages to and from Microsoft Teams to allow for continuous collaboration across multiple teams and channels. These bots can work with [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/integrations/microsoft-teams?view=azure-devops), [work items](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/integrations/boards-teams?view=azure-devops) and [code pull requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/integrations/repos-teams?view=azure-devops).

For monitoring and orchestrating deployments across our various teams, the Azure Pipelines bot is essential. Let's begin by setting up subscriptions to monitor a release pipeline.

**<u>NOTE: The rest of this document will be using a release pipeline as an example, but this will also work with multi-stage build pipelines that utilize environments.</u>**

### Configuring the Azure Pipelines Bot in Microsoft Teams

Use the "subscriptions" keyword  with the Azure Pipelines bot to review and modify existing subscriptions and add new ones. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/DevOps/Teams-Azure-Pipelines-Subscriptions.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

In the above example, we are subscribing to any changes in stages or approvals for a specific release pipeline. Its recommend to filter to a specific pipeline to reduce clutter in our Teams messaging. The Azure Pipeline bot, using actions described in the article "", can be further filtered by build statuses. This is helpful to isolate the messages delivered to a specific Teams channel.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/DevOps/Teams-Azure-Pipelines-Subscriptions-Filter.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Once configured, as soon as our pipeline begins to run, Microsoft Teams will begin to receive messages. Below is an example showing the deployment of a specific release including stages and approval requests. What I find nice about this is that Microsoft Teams works on both my mobile devices and even Linux based operating systems, allowing any team on any workload to utilize this approach.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/DevOps/Teams-Azure-Pipelines-Notifications-Thread-GatedApproval.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

I also want to point out that Azure DevOps also has the ability to natively integrate with other 3rd party tools such as [Slack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/integrations/slack?view=azure-devops) (Similar to the Teams bots), [ServiceNow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/servicenow?view=azure-devops) and [Jenkins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/integrate-jenkins-pipelines-cicd?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml).

## Release Pipelines

#### Quality Deployments

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/gates?view=azure-devops&viewFallbackFrom=vsts

Deployments within a release pipeline allow for numerous ways to integrate monitoring into Azure DevOps processes. Each deployment include pre and post conditions which can be leveraged to send events and metrics. For instance, the Azure Function gate can be used to invoke a micro service that writes to App Insights, creates ServiceNow tickets or even Kafka events. The possibilities are endless, imagine sending messages back to the Power Platform for each stage of a deployment!

##### Approvals

Pre and Post approvals can be added to each job in the release pipeline. Adding these can assist during a complex deployment requiring coordination between multiple teams dispersed geographically. Shown below is a hypothetical setup of multiple teams each with specific deliverables as part of a release. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/OrchestrateRelease.TeamsChannels.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />

In this scenario, a core solution needs to be deployed and installed before relying features can begin. When any of the steps in the delivery process begins, the originating team needs to be notified in case of any issues that come up. Using approvals allows the lead of the specific feature team to align the resources and communicate to the broader team that the process can move forward.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/Teams-Overview.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Here is an example of an approval within Microsoft Teams, notifying the lead of the core solution team that the import process is ready. The approval request shows the build artifacts (e.g. solutions, code files, etc), the branch and pipeline information.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/DevOps/Teams-Azure-Pipelines-Notifications-Thread-GatedApproval-Filtered-Team.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### Deployment Gates

At the heart of a gated deployment approach is the ability to search for inconsistencies or negative signals to minimize unwanted impact further in the process. These gates, which can be set to run before or after a deployment job, allow us to query for potential issues and alerts. They also could be used to notify or perform an operation on an external system.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/DevOps/ReleasePipeline-PreDeployment-ReleaseGates.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

##### Queries and Alerts

Deployment gates provide the ability to run queries on work items within your **Azure DevOps** project. For instance this allows release coordinators and deployment managers to check for bugs reported from automated testing using RSAT for **Dynamics 365 F&O** or EasyRepro for **Dynamics 365 CE**. These queries are created within the Work Items area of **Azure DevOps**. From there they are referenced within the pipeline and based on the data returned, upper and lower thresholds can be set. If these thresholds are crossed, the gate condition is not satisified and the process will halt until corrections are made.

##### External Integrations

As mentioned above **Azure Function** is natively integrated within deployment gates for **Release Pipelines**. **<u>These can be used for both a pre condition and post condition to report or integrate with external systems</u>**. 

Deployment gates can also **invoke REST API endpoints**. **<u>This could be used within the Power Platform to query the CDS API or run Power Automate flows.</u>** An example could be to query the **Common Data Service** for running asynchronous jobs, creating activities within a **Dynamics 365** environment or admin actions such as **enabling Admin mode**. Another could be to use the robust approval process built in **Power Automate** for pre and post approvals outside of the **Azure DevOps** licensed user base. 

## Using Build Pipelines or Release Pipelines

In the previous section I described how to introduce quality gates to a release securing each stage of the pipeline. Release pipelines are useful

### Environments

[Environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments?view=azure-devops) in Azure DevOps allow for **<u>targeted deployment of artifacts to a collection of resources</u>**. In the case of the **Power Platform**, this can be thought of **<u>a release to an Power Platform environment</u>**. The use of pipeline environments is optional, that is unless you begin work using Release pipelines which do require environments. Two of the main advantages of environments are deployment history and security and permissions.

### Scenario: Securing Current Deployments

In this scenario, we will attempt to secure our Power Platform environment using security checks and policies. With build environments we can configure conditions such as only releasing during specific time frames, approvals from stakeholders, azure function responses or even requiring templates and tasks. In the below example, we will require three conditions to be met before releasing to an environment: Approvals from team members, required extends templates and artifact policy enforcement.

### Environment Security Checks

Environment security checks, as mentioned above, can provide quality gates similar to the current capabilities of Release Pipelines. Below is an example of the current options, I've highlighted the ones I'm using in this scenario.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/Environment.Checks.Overview.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Compare this to the Release Pipeline Pre or Post Deployment Quality Gates.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/ReleasePipeline-PreDeployment-ReleaseGates.JPG" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Environments allow DevOps administrators the ability to review and manage each deployment. With this control also comes auditing of previous deployments allowing insight into trends and potential vulnerabilities. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/Environment.RequiredTemplate.GitHubSourced.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />

Each attempted deployment to an environment includes [an execution record](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/distributedtask/environmentdeployment%20records/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0#environmentdeploymentexecutionrecord) that can expose [stage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/stages?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) (orchestrations and divisions) and [job](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) (sequential tasks) details. For each deployment record we can find out a wealth of information. Build definitions, plans, stages, jobs are all shown. The start and finish timings and statuses are also shown, helping engineers determine where things may have gone wrong.

#### Quick Note on Security Checks

Each deployment, that meets security checks, will be included within the execution record REST API list. If the deployment is not found, most likely it is awaiting or failed a specific conditional check. As of this writing, the ability to read pending deployments awaiting checks such as approvals is not straight forward. That said, using Web Hooks, as discussed in the Web Hooks section of the article "", we can see acknowledgement of a pending approval. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/Environment.ApprovalCheck.WebHook.PNG" style="zoom:50%;" />

In this scenario we can be notified, other checks currently do not allow for flexibility. Feel free to upvote this request to gain traction on adding this to the REST API.

## Scenario: Orchestrating a Release

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/Ochestrate Release with Teams.gif" style="zoom:50%;" />

In the above example, we have a multi-stage release pipeline that encompasses multiple teams from development to support to testing. The pipeline relies on multiple artifacts and code branches for importing and testing. 

In this example, we have a core solution containing Dynamics 365 entity changes that are needed by integrations. They will need to lead the deployment and test and notify the subsequent teams that everything has passed and can move on. Below is an example of coordination between the deployment team and the Core team lead.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/Ochestrate Release with Teams.gif" style="zoom:50%;" />

Below is an image showing the entire release deployment with stages completed.

## Automating Release Notes

##### Azure Application Insights Release Annotations

The Azure Application Insights Release Annotations task is a marketplace extension from Microsoft allowing a release pipeline to signal an event in a release pipeline. An event could be the start of the pipeline, the end, or any event we are interested in. From here we can use native functionality of Application Insights to stream metrics and logs.
