# Monitoring the Power Platform: Model Driven Apps - Common Data Service for Analytics

## Summary

The idea of monitoring **Dynamics 365 or Model Driven Applications** is not a new concept. Understanding where services are **failing**, users are **interacting** with the platform, where **form** and **business processes** could be **tuned for performance** are key drivers for most if not all businesses, from small companies to enterprises. Luckily, the **Dynamics 365** platform provides many tools to help audit and monitor business and operational events.

This article will cover locating and downloading environment analytics using the **Common Data Service for Analytics**. Questions regarding capacity and all up usage can be answered here. For operational events the **Release Wave 1 2020 for Power Apps** will be explored for feature announcement to allow for both manual and automated gathering and alerting. 

## Organization Insights / CDS for Analytics

A Common Data Service specific feature is the former Organization Insights or now called the **Common Data Service for Analytics** or **CDS-A**. Its key to point out here that Organization Insights will no longer be supported in future releases per [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service). Some of the key analytics compiled include **active user usage** and **operations performed**, **customizations used**, **storage consumed** and **failed workflows and API** calls.

### CDS for Analytics in the Power Platform Admin Center

Analytics for the Common Data Service can be observed within the **Power Platform Admin Center**. To navigate to these analytics, simply expand the Analytics area of the PPAC and choose "**Common Data Service**".

#### Who can access this data?

Its key here to point out that access to this data is limited based on user access to the CDS environment in combination with their Office 365 role. As shown in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#who-can-view-these-reports) there consist of various admin roles within Office 365 that will scope to specific reports. **Environment Admin will scope to environments the admin has access to** while other admin roles will expose every environment.

#### Navigating the Portal

With the appropriate permissions, an admin will land on the **Home** dashboard for Common Data Service for Analytics. Below is an overview of each of the dashboards available currently.

As described in the article, **each of these metrics is updated every 24 hours**.

The **Home** dashboard includes the ability to filter to specific environments and time range to help focus on finding out more about a particular question. **Active Users, API Calls and Pass Rate** are shown as well as top **Plug-Ins by Failure**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/CDSA/CDSA-Home-Overview.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

[The **Active Users** dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#active-users) is helpful to seeing which **users are most active** during what timeframe and what **operations are being performed by the most active users**. **Total operations** (*Create*, *Retrieve and RetrieveMultiple*, *Update* and *Delete*) per day and **total page requests** are shown with line charts.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/CDSA/CDSA-Overview-ActiveUsers.JPG" style="zoom: 50%;" />

[The **Mode of Access** dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#active-users) can help admins better understand **user client usage** (OS, device, browser type) and **active users by business units and security roles**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/CDSA/CDSA-ModeOfAccess.JPG" style="zoom: 50%;" />

[The **Entity Usage** dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#active-users) displays the **most active entities** **by operation**, split by out of the box (OOB) and custom entities.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/CDSA/CDSA-EntityUsage.JPG" style="zoom: 50%;" />

[The **System Jobs** dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#system-jobs) is useful to admins for help understanding **throughput numbers** and **pass rates**. The **active and top workflow reports** show the **top 10 most executed and failing workflows** for the overall specified time, while the **throughput metrics are broken down per hours**.

Shown below is another dashboard I find very useful, [the **Plug-Ins** Dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#plug-ins). Within this dashboard, data points for **success or pass rate**, **number of executions**, **most active plug-ins** and **top plug-ins by failure** can be found.

[The **Mailbox Usage** dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#mailbox-usage) enables admins to visualize **mailbox configurations** and **active email mailboxes and profiles**. Utilizing data from [Server-side Synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/server-side-synchronization), admins can review **incoming and outgoing configurations**, **which mailboxes are enabled** and **how many are using the service**.

The Common Data Service API is heavily used in the Power Apps platform and the final dashboard, [the **API Calls Statistics** dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#api-call-statistics). This dashboard will help admins see the API success rate, most used API calls, all up API calls and top failing API calls.

#### Filtering the data returned

The Common Data Service for Analytics will show environments an admin has access to review data for. During acceptance or end to end testing, admins may want to focus on a specific environment and time range. [To do this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#view-data-for-different-environments-and-date-time-ranges), click the "**Change filters**" button for any dashboard.

#### Export data for Analysis

Data from the Common Data Service for Analytics dashboards can be exported to an Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for further review and storage by clicking the "Download" button. As the image below shows, data points can be collected that may not necessarily be visualized in the PPAC.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/aliyoussefi/D365-Monitoring/Artifacts/CDSA/CDSA-Download-AvailableOptions.JPG" style="zoom:33%;" />

The data included in the downloaded spreadsheet will present more data than shown in the dashboard reports. For instance the API Used spreadsheet shows operations for each entity down to a single call.

These spreadsheets can be used as a source for Microsoft Power BI reports or even uploaded to Azure Application Insights, Azure Log Analytics for Azure Blob Storage for extended capabilities. 

### Common Data Service for Analytics PowerShell cmdlets

Starting in July 2020 the [**PowerShell cmdlets for Power Apps**](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell/2.0.56) will be **[generally available](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform-release-plan/2020wave1/power-platform-governance-administration/powershell-cmdlets-power-apps-admins-are-generally)** allowing for automation of tasks typically performed in the Power Platform Admin Center. [These commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#powerapps-cmdlets-for-administrators-preview) allow admins the ability to perform management tasks on environments and environment permissions. Admins can govern CDS and underlying technologies such as custom connectors, Power Automate Flows, CDS databases, Canvas Apps, etc. 

According to the [Release Wave 1 2020 article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform-release-plan/2020wave1/power-platform-governance-administration/powershell-cmdlets-power-automate-admins-are-generally), new cmdlets will be available allowing for managing capacity, user permissions and lifecycle operations for an environment. 

### Service Health within the Power Platform Admin Center

Recently announced in the Release Wave 1 for 2020 is a [unified service health experience within the Power Platform Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform-release-plan/2020wave1/power-platform-governance-administration/unified-service-health-experience-power-platform-admin-center). This will allow admins the ability to focus efforts within the PPAC and not have to navigate to the Office 365 Portal or build automation for service health. This can also provide the potential to limit the environment admins from interacting with Office 365 items like Active Users and Licenses, Groups, Subscriptions, etc. [According to the article the ability to set up alerts for service outages will be coming as part of the September 2020 general availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform-release-plan/2020wave1/power-platform-governance-administration/service-health-power-platform-admin-center).

## Next Steps

As the Common Data Service for Analytics feature evolves, I expect administrators will be given increased visibility and tooling to assist with the governance of CDS environments. Until then continue exploring the dashboard and export capabilities to assist with unification of CDS environment activity. As touched on briefly, there are mechanisms available now to help build custom reporting and alerting which will be elaborated on in another article.
